2. PRESENTATION
---------------

Anope is a set of Services for IRC networks that allows users to
manage their nicks and channels in a secure and efficient way, and
administrators to manage their network with powerful tools.

Currently available services are:

  * NickServ, a powerful nickname manager that users can use to
  protect themselves against nick stealing. Each user has its
  own nickname group, that allows him to register as many nicks as
  he needs while still being able to take profit of his privileges
  and to modify his nick configuration. NickServ also has an optional 
  password retrieval feature.

  * ChanServ, a powerful channel manager that helps users to administer
  their channels in a totally customizable way. ChanServ has an internal
  list of privileged users and banned users that controls accesses
  on a per-channel basis. It eliminates all takeover problems,
  because of its powerful op/unban/invite and even mass deop and mass
  kick functions.
  
  * MemoServ, an helpful companion that allows sending short messages
  to offline users, that they can then read when they come online
  later.
  
  * BotServ, an original service that allows users to get a permanent,
  friendly bot on their channels in an easy way. Each bot can be
  configured to monitor the channels against floods, repetitions,
  caps writing, swear, and take appropriate actions. It also can
  handle user-friendly commands (!op,!deop,!voice,!devoice,!kick,...),
  say a short greet message when an user joins a channel, and even
  "take over" ChanServ actions such as auto-opping users, saying the
  entry notice, and so on. This service can be disabled if you
  want to save some bandwidth.
  
  * OperServ, the IRCops' and IRC admins' black box, that allows them
  to manage the list of network bans (also known as AKILL (DALnet) or 
  GLINE (Undernet)), to configure messages displayed to users when
  they log on, to set modes and to kick users from any channel,
  to send notices quickly to the entire network, and much more!

  * HostServ, a neat service that allows users to show custom
  vHosts (virtual hosts) instead of their real IP address; this only
  works on daemons supporting ip cloaking, such as UnrealIRCd and
  UltimateIRCd.

  * HelpServ, a skeleton service used to serve help files.

Anope currently works with:
  - DreamForge 4.6.7
  - Bahamut 1.4.35 or later (including 1.8)
  - UnrealIRCd 3.1.1 or later (including 3.2)
  - UltimateIRCd 2.8.2 or later (including 3.0.0)
  - ViagraIRCd 1.3 or later
  - Hybrid 7 or later
  - PTlink 6.15 or later
  - RageIRCd 2.0 beta-6 or later

Anope could also work with some of the daemons derived by the ones 
listed above, but there's no support for them if they work or don't
work.


3. INSTALLATION
---------------

See the INSTALL file.


4. COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
-----------------------

     Normally, Anope can be run simply by invoking the "services"
executable.  Anope will then use the defaults specified in the
services.conf file, and connect to the specified uplink server.
Alternatively, any of the following command-line options can be specified
to change the default values:

    -remote server[:port]    Connect to the specified server
    -local host  -or-        Connect from the specified address (e.g.
           [host]:[port]        for multihomed servers)
    -name servername         Our server name (e.g. services.some.net)
    -desc string             Description of us (e.g. SomeNet Services)
    -user username           Username for Services' nicks (e.g. services)
    -host hostname           Hostname for Services' nicks (e.g. esper.net)
    -dir directory           Directory containing Services' data files
                                (e.g. /usr/local/lib/services)
    -log filename            Services log filename (e.g. services.log)
    -update secs             How often to update databases (in seconds)
    -expire secs             How often to check for nick/channel
                                expiration (in seconds)

     Additionally, the following command-line options can be used to modify
the behavior of Anope:

    -debug          Enable debugging mode--more info sent to log
                        (give option more times for more info)
    -readonly       Enable read-only mode--no changes to
                        databases allowed, .db files and log
                        not written
    -skeleton       Enable skeleton mode--like read-only mode,
                        but only OperServ is available
    -nofork         Do not fork after startup; log messages will
                        be written to terminal (as well as to
                        the log file if not in read-only mode)
    -forceload      Try to load as much of the databases as
                        possible, even if errors are encountered
    -noexpire       Expiration routines won't be run at all
    -logchan        Startup with logchan enabled
    -version	    Display the version of Anope

     Upon starting, Anope will parse its command-line parameters, open
its logfile, then (assuming the -nofork option is not given) detach itself
and run in the background.  If Anope encounters a problem reading the
database files or cannot connect to its uplink server, it will terminate
immediately; otherwise, it will run until the connection is terminated (or
a QUIT, SHUTDOWN, or RESTART command is sent--see OperServ's help).  In the
case of an error, an appropriate error message will be written to the log
file.

     If Anope is run with the "-readonly" command-line option, it can
serve as a "backup" to the full version of services.  A "full" version of
services (run without -readonly) will automatically reintroduce its
pseudo-clients (NickServ, ChanServ, etc.), while a "backup" services will
not, thus allowing full services to be brought up at any time without
disrupting the network (and without having to take backup services down
beforehand).

     If Anope is run with the "-skeleton" command-line option, it will
not try to load the nickname or channel databases, and will respond with
"service is inactive" messages to any commands sent to NickServ, ChanServ,
MemoServ or BotServ.  This can be useful as an emergency stopgap measure 
when the main copy of Anope cannot be started.

     The "-debug" option is useful if you find or suspect a problem in
Anope. Giving it once on the command line will cause all traffic to and
from services as well as some other debugging information to be recorded in
the log file; if you send a bug report, PLEASE include an excerpt from the
log file WITH DEBUGGING ACTIVE--I cannot emphasize enough how important
this is to tracking down problems.  (You can also enable debugging while
Services is running using OperServ's SET DEBUG command.)  If you repeat the
-debug option more than once, the debugging level will be increased, which
provides more detailed information but may also slow Anope down
considerably and make the log file grow dramatically faster (in particular,
at debug level 4 a message is written to the log for every character
received from the server).  In general, a debug level of 1 is sufficient
for the coding team to be able to trace a problem, because all network 
traffic is included and we can usually reproduce the problem.

     The "-forceload" option is provided to attempt recovery of data from
corrupted or truncated databases.  Normally, if Anope encounters an
error writing to a database file, it will attempt to restore the original
version of the file and report an error to the logfile and through WALLOPS.
However, if this should fail (which normally should not happen), or if
Anope is terminated abruptly e.g. by kill -9 or a power failure, then
one or more of the databases may be corrupt.  Normally, this will cause
Anope to abort the next time you try to run it; however, if you give
the -forceload option to Anope, it will instead read as much as it can,
then skip to the next database.  For obvious reasons, it's recommended to
keep backup copies of your databases in case something does happen (since
Anope will stop at the first error even with -forceload, meaning you
lose any data after that).


5. MESSAGES TRANSLATIONS
------------------------

Anope has a powerful option in NickServ allowing users to choose what
language it must use when sending messages to users. Messages
are stored in language files (located in the lang directory).

Anope is currently provided with eleven languages: Catalan, Dutch, English,
French, German, Greek, Italian, Portuguese, Russian, Spanish and 
Turkish. If you want to translate Anope messages into another language,
follow the following instructions:

  * Copy the lang/en_us.l file to a meaningful name (for example, if
    you would like to translate messages in Spanish, you would
    rename it to es.l).
  * Edit the file with your favorite text editor. Carefully read
    the instructions given at the top of the file, and start
    translating the whole file. The file is big so make sure you have
    some coffee available. ;) Try to avoid the use of English words
    as much as possible. If the new language contains only a few 'special' 
    characters, try and use latin representations of it, if possible. 
    Remember that most clients are only capable of handling the 
    ISO-8859-1 charset. Of course, if you are translating Anope to a 
    language with a totally different charset, such as Russian, feel free 
    to use the one that suites it best (and the one that is in use by 
    most speakers of that language ;).
  * When this is done, you have two solutions: either patch Services
    source code so they take in account the new language file (basically,
    you'll have to modify lang/Makefile, language.c and maybe services.h),
    or send us the translated file so we can make the patch and 
    include your language in the next Anope release.
  * Note that there is a language tool on bin/langtool.pl that can aid
    the verification process on newly created language files. Try to use
    it before you submit a language file.

When new major releases come out, you'll not have to retranslate the whole
file; the Changes.lang file will help you to know which messages were
added, modified or deleted.

If you did a language file translation, and want to let others use it,
please send it to dev@anope.org (don't forget to mention clearly your
(nick)name, your e-mail and the language name). You'll of course get full
credit for it, and will even get future final major releases before anyone 
else to complete the translation!... ;) 


6. CONTACT
---------------------------

* For announcements and discussions about Anope, please visit our Portal
and Forums at http://www.anope.org/ make sure you register yourself and
your network to get full benefits.

* If you read the documentation carefully, and didn't find the answer
to your question, feel free to post on the website forums or join our 
irc channel (irc.anope.org #anope). Once you join our Support channel,
just type "? report" for instructions on how to report a Bug. Be as 
precise as possible when asking a question, because we have no extraordinary 
powers and can't guess things if they aren't provided. The more precise you 
are, the sooner you'll be likely to get an answer.

* If you think you found a bug, add it to the bug tracking system on our 
website (http://www.anope.org) and - again - be as precise as possible. Also 
say whether the bug happens always or under what circumstances, and anything 
that could be useful to track your bug down. If you wrote a patch, send it 
over. :)

* We do *not* support Windows versions of Anope. You must seek support from
the website you downloaded the Windows port from. Anope Services was never
meant to run on Windows... it might in the future, but for the time being
you are on your own. And for Mac fans... Anope runs like a champ on OSX.
