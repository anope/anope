How To Add IRCd Support
-----------------------

1) Files to Edit
2) Modifing the Header File
3) The Code
4) Modes
5) Functions / Events
6) CAPAB/PROTOCTL 

1) Files to Edit

    When preparing to add support to Anope for your ircd, you need to edit
    the following files. 

    A) Make a copy of the .c and .h file of the IRCd that matches the ircd
       that you are attempting to add support for best.
    B) Make a backup copy of include/services.h, include/sysconf.h.in
    C) Make a backup copy of Config and configure.in

    First step in this process is to rename the .c and .h file after the IRCd
    that you are going to be adding support for. Its recommended that you come
    up with a name that is clear and easy to understand.

    Now that you have the files that you will need to create your own ircd
    support, starting with Config. This file is a shell script file; scroll
    down until you find the list of ircs for the user to select. Indicate
    the based ircd version which is supported such as a series 1.x or 2.2.x,
    placing in the comment side an exact version that the support is for or
    "experimental" if you are not the ircd developer. The next step is to
    decide how the IRCd will be defined, following the existing examples edit
    'IRCTYPE_DEF="IRC_RATBOX"' to be the descriptive define for your ircd. 

    With the Config file ready to go, edit configure.in and find in there the
    reference to --with-ircd. You should see the various other ircds, and
    you will want to add yours in there using the same IRC_ name you came up
    with above. Important in this step is to make sure that you set the
    IRCDFILE to the name of the .c file you set in step 1. Once you have the
    configure.in created you can remove the old configure and at the command
    prompt type "autconf"; this will generate the new configure file.

    Getting close to actually modify code. Open sysconf.h.in and add two
    lines for your given ircd, which is similar to this:

        /* "First IRCD type" */
        #undef IRC_RATBOX

    Open services.h and add a line with the rest of the ircd include files to
    match the name of the .h file you set in step 1. 

        #include "ratbox.h"

    Taking the .c and .h file open them and replace the #ifdef IRC_* with the
    IRC_ name you set in step two. Ensure that the code comments at the top
    of the file match the ircd that the code will be for.

    You are now ready to start getting into the code.

2) Modifying the Header File

    Now that you have gotten past the first part of the creation process, you
    are into the code. This part is the harder and more complex part. You
    will need a general understanding of C code to continue. Here are the
    step by step instructions required to make this work.

    Open the .h file and find the section of code with

        #define PROTECT_SET_MODE "+"
        #define PROTECT_UNSET_MODE "-"
        #define CS_CMD_PROTECT "PROTECT"
        #define CS_CMD_DEPROTECT "DEPROTECT"
        #define FANT_PROTECT_ADD "!protect"
        #define FANT_PROTECT_DEL "!deprotect"
        #define LEVEL_PROTECT_WORD "AUTOPROTECT"
        #define LEVELINFO_PROTECT_WORD "PROTECT"
        #define LEVELINFO_PROTECTME_WORD "PROTECTME"

    If the ircd supports a protective/admin (not owner) mode, set the
    PROTECT_SET_MODE and PROTECT_UNSET_MODE to be that mode. On most ircds
    it's usermode "a" so you will be setting it to "+a" and "-a". The next
    two are based more on what this mode is called. When you message ChanServ
    to get this mode, this is the command you will be using. After this are
    the fantasy commands which can be used in channel to get these modes. The
    next three relate to the ACCESS LEVEL list system. Again these are the
    words to gain these levels in the ACCESS LEVEL system. If your ircd does
    not have these functions, leave them at what ever value is currently set;
    the core code will ignore the request of the user.

    Now that this is set, you can define the MODES. All user modes are stored
    with UMODE_ followed by a letter matching the modes case; be careful to
    use the correct case as this will make it clear when you setup MODES in
    the .c in a few. Use hex values for the modes so starting at 0x00000001
    to 0x8000000. In most cases you want to list all modes. If you run out of
    values look at removing any modes that do not impact services.

    Channel modes are done much like user modes, with the exception that
    bans, exceptions, invites, and modes that are applied to a user such as
    op and voice are not defined here. All other modes are defined in here.
    Again be clear and use the correct case and use hex values as done with
    user modes.

    Finally we come to DEFAULT_MLOCK; this is the mode that services will set
    by default on channels when they are registered. In general you want this
    to be what is acceptable by the ircd; in most cases this is "+nt"

3) The Code

    Here is where the code of the .c file comes in. Be prepared to spend at
    least an hour, if not longer, going over the code and getting it right;
    Especially if you are setting up an ircd that is completely different
    than the one you used as a base. This section covers the majority of the
    code that is in use. 

    The first bit of code you will face is:

        const char version_protocol[] = "Ratbox IRCD";

    This the protocol name which will appear in various places; especially
    when you do -version at the command prompt, this is where you state the
    server name. The version is not always needed unless you are showing that
    the support is for one branch of a ircd family, such as Unreal 3.1 and
    Unreal 3.2.

    Once you have decided on this little piece of code, you will come to
    flood mode characters being used for setting and removing. If your IRCd
    does not support flood modes, you can just use ""; we will be setting if
    your IRCD supports flooding or not in a little bit.

        const char flood_mode_char_set[] = "+f";
        const char flood_mode_char_remove[] = "-f";

    The next task that you will face is setting whether the IRCD sends time
    stamps on modes but does not tell us that it will do so. If it does, set
    UseTSMODE to 1; if it does not set it to be 0. If you're not sure refer
    to your IRCd's documentation on how MODE is sent.

        int UseTSMODE = 0;

    Now you've come to the part where you setup your ircd. There are two
    structs which hold this information; This allows you to quickly setup
    your specific ircd.

        IRCDVar ircd[] = { }

    This struct contains your basic IRCd functions. Your base source file has
    the list of all available variables; note that you should not swap any
    around, or you will break stuff. Here is a brief description of the usage
    of each.

    1) Name: This member tells Anope about the IRCD's name. It may contain
             text about it's name and version. This is used to identify the
             build on startup.

    2) NickServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on NickServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                      or a services flag. 

    3) ChanServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on ChanServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,

    5) HostServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on HostServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                      or a services flag. Note that if your ircd does not
                      support HostServ, you can safely make this NULL or +,
                      as there is a check before bringing HostServ online.

    6) OperServ Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on OperServ.
                      Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,

    10) Global Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on Global.
                     Normally you want this to be some form of oper flag,
                     or a services flag. 

    11) NickServ Alias Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on the alias
                             of NickServ. Normally you want this to be some
                             form of oper flag, or a services flag.

                             form of oper flag, or a services flag. Note that
                             if your ircd does not support HostServ, you can
                             safely make this NULL or +, as there is a check
                             before bringing HostServ online.

    19) Global Alias Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on the alias
                           of Global. Normally you want this to be some form
                           of oper flag, or a services flag. 

    20) BotServ Bots Mode: This is the user mode set by Anope on all BotServ
                           bots. Normally you want this to be a some form of
                           service or bot flag; you can use + for no mode at

                                 modes that can appear before a nick. Do
                                 remember to count each possible mode, so +ov
                                 is 2.

                         stripping channel modes.

    23) Channelmode for bots: When a BotServ bot joins a channel, this is the
                              mode set on them. Normally you will want them
                              opped (+o), and protected (+a) on IRCd's that
                              support it.

                          If the IRCd dosn't support admins, set to NULL.

    31) Mode on Nick Register: What mode to give users when they register
                               with NickServ. If your ircd doesn't set expect
                               a mode to be set on registration, you should
                               set this to NULL.

    32) Mode on Nick Unregister: What mode to set give users when they cancel
                                 their registration with NickServ. If your

                                 you should set this to NULL.

    33) Mode on Nick Change: What mode to give users when they change their
                             nick. If your ircd doesn't set a mode, you
                             should set this to NULL.

    79) SVSMODE UCMODE: Can we clear user channel modes with SVSMODE? Use
                        1 for yes, 0 for no.

    80) SGline Enforce: Does the IRCd enforce SGLINES for us or do we need to
                        do so? Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    81) Vhost Character: The character used to represent the vHost mode, if
                         this is supported by the IRCd.

    82) TS6: Does the IRCd support TS6? Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    83) UMode +h: Does the IRCd support usermode +h for helpers?
                  Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    84) P10: Is this IRCd a P10-style IRCd? Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    85) Character Set: Unreal passes the character set during PROTOCTL,
                       the value is stored here. Set this NULL to start.

    86) Reports sync: Does the IRCd report when it's in sync (or done bursting,
                      depending on how you want to say it)? Remember to set
                      the sync state for servers correctly if it does.
                      Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    87) Channel CIDR: Set to 1 if channel bans, excepts and invites
                      support CIDR masks. Expected syntax: *!*@ip/mask.
                      When set to 1, anope will only parse strict CIDR masks.
                      IRCd's that try to correct invalid CIDR's (like nefarious)
                      will need a custom implementation in the core.
                      Contact the anope Dev Team if this is the case.
                      Set to 0 if CIDR's are not supported by your IRCd.

    88) Throttle Mode: The IRCd has a channelmode for throttling joins per-user. 
                       Use 1 for yes, 0 for no.

    89) CMode j: CMODE_ that defines throttle mode. Use 0 for no support.

    90) Delayed client introduction: Delay the introduction of services pseudo-
                                     client till after we have received the uplinks
                                     CAPAB.

    So we've had this long list. Now there's a second struct to fill. This
    struct isn't as long as the previous one though, so we'll handle it quite
    quick compared to the previous one.

        IRCDCAPAB ircdcap[] = { }

    This struct is based on the CAPAB defines. You should review the CAPAB
    table below to see how this should be done.

4) Modes 

    The next thing you should do is defining the user modes. You will want to
    have your .h file handy for this part.

        unsigned long umodes[128] = { }

    This array goes from 0 to 127 in the ASCII character set. Insert the user
    modes at the slot where the mode fits. If you are adding a the user mode
    of +i find the 105th (ASCII code of 'i') character slot in the array, and
    place the UMODE_i into this slot. Your base .c file should contain a good
    start for this, as well as a little help locating the characters.

	The following mode set is for the channel symbols. During a SJOIN event 
    the modes are sent usually before the nick. These normally are @, +, %
    etc.. depending on the ircd. Starting at ASCII 0 and running to 127. 
    Replace the 0 with the character (o = @, h = %) for the given mode. In the
    case of halfop which is usually sent as % replace the 37th character with
    'h', do this until all modes that are possible be received in this manor 
    have been inserted into the array.

	Now that you have that complete, the following array is ready to be dealt
    with. This is the cmmodes array, like the others it is a ASCII array
	starting at 0 and going to 127. However at the given letter you will want
    to enter the add, and delete function for the given mode. In the case of
    bans (+b) there is add_ban, and del_ban. Anope provides functions for 
    bans, exceptions and invites, should your ircd have more then these please
    contact Anope to discuss what can be done to add this mode.

5) Functions and Events

    A brief word about functions and events. All events are captured using:

        void moduleAddIRCDMsgs(void)
        {
            m = createMessage("NICK", anope_event_nick); 
            addCoreMessage(IRCD,m);
        }

    Each event should have a event handler if its important enough to be
    processed by services. All event functions should be formed like this:

        int anope_event_capab(char *source, int ac, char **av)
        {
            return MOD_CONT;
        }

    They will receive the source; this can be NULL at times depending on the
    event. Next, ac is the number of arguments that are in the event, and av
    holds the values for each; so av[0] is the first variable, av[1] will be
    the second one, and so on. Events are likely to pass to various upper
    level event handlers; see the previous ircd source for how they handle
    these events.

    All commands are formed like this:

        void anope_cmd_svsnoop(char *server, int set)
        {
            send_cmd(NULL, "SVSNOOP %s %s", server, (set ? "+" : "-"));
        }

    They may take any number of arguments, depending on the command. They
    should eventually come to a send_cmd(); this root function is how
    commands are sent to the IRCd.

6) CAPAB/PROTOCTL

    Most IRCD send a CAPAB or PROTOCTL line so that they can work out what
    the other end of the connection is capable of doing. Anope has a function
    to read these lines and set itself up to to handle these events better.
    When adding support for your ircd, take the following steps.

    1) In the ircd.c find the function anope_cmd_capab(); this function will
       send the CAPAB/PROTOCTL line (consult your ircd documentation for
       which to send). In a single line type in the tokens that anope must
       send. Here is an example of Hybrid's capab line:

        /* CAPAB */
        void anope_cmd_capab()
        {
            send_cmd(NULL, "CAPAB TS5 EX IE HOPS HUB AOPS");
        }

    2) In the ircd.h file make sure to place the defines (see below) that
       match your IRCd's tokens; only use the ones that matter to your ircd.
       Should your IRCd add new features not covered in the defined, please
       contact the Anope Dev team before doing so. See README for information
       on how to contact the Anope team.

    3) Ensure that the CAPAB/PROTOCTL event his handled correctly. 

        A) In the function "moduleAddIRCDMsgs" making sure that you have the
           following two lines:
   
            m = createMessage("CAPAB", anope_event_capab); 
            addCoreMessage(IRCD,m);

        B) Add the function to handle the event

            int anope_event_capab(char *source, int ac, char **av)
            {
                capab_parse(ac, av);
                return MOD_CONT;
            }

           This function should call the capab_parse function which parses
           the received CAPAB/PROTOCTL line.
