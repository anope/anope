1) Building the Source

    NOTE: If you have downloaded one of the pre-compiled installers, you do
          NOT need to complete this step, and you can proceed to step 2.

    If you want to build Anope from source on a Win32 system, you will need
    to follow this instructions:

    1) Download the required files:

        * Current Anope source:
            http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=94081

        * CMake:
            http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html

        (NOTE: When installing, tell CMake to add itself to the PATH.)

        If you have Visual C++ 10 (2010) skip ahead to step 2, else you
        need to download the following free components from Microsoft. Once
        downloaded, install these packages.

        * Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition:
            http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/

        or

        then download and install:

        * Microsoft Windows 2008 SDK:
            http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=E6E1C3DF-A74F-4207-8586-711EBE331CDC&displaylang=en

        (NOTE: Although they say for Windows Server 2003 or 2008, they do infact work on all supported
        versions of Windows. When installing the 2003 SDK, you should select the Custom option, and only select
        to have the Microsoft Windows Core SDK installed. When installing the 2008 SDK, you should select the
        Custom option, and only select to have the Developer Tools installed, but also expand that and deselect
        the Visual C++ Compilers as well as the Mobile Tools. Doing this will decrease the install time as well
        as the space used by the SDK.)

    2) Unpack the Anope tarball with your favorite uncompression program
       (WinZip or WinRAR, etc).

    3) (Note before this step: If you fall under one of the situations at the end of Step 1 where it says that the
       SDK will not work out of the box, do not bring up the Visual C++ Command Prompt by using the link in
       the Windows Start Menu. Instead, edit vsvars32.bat in the directory where you unpacked the source code
       in step 2, so the first line that says "@SET VSINSTALLDIR=<whatever>" has the directory where you installed
       Visual C++ Express to, if different from the default. Save the file and then run it instead.)

       Bring up the Visual C++ Command Prompt; This will launch a
       DOS Command Prompt like window, which will set the environment
       properties needed to make Anope.

       Create a new directory, which will be used to hold the build files. You can make it
       be a directory under the source directory unpacked in step 2, or somewhere else entirely.

       Change directories to this new folder, by typing:

          cd <path to build directory>

          e.g.

          cd c:\anope-build

    4) You now need to configure Anope to your requirements. At the prompt type:

        <path to source directory>\Config.exe

       NOTE: If you run an Anti-Virus program such as McAfee or Norton, you may
       be unable to run this command due to the protection in place. Some Anti-
       Virus programs may detect the Anope Configuration Tool as a worm, however
       this is not the case. If you are prompted to allow or deny execution of
       the script, you should choose allow. If the script fails to run, and no
       notice is displayed, please check your Anti-Virus settings before seeking
       assistance.

       An interactive configuration program should guide you through the install
       options. You will be given a choice to use NMake or not. NMake will compile
       inside the command prompt window you are in. If you want to build within
       the Visual C++ IDE, say no to that option, and it'll create a Solution for
       you to open up.

       If you cannot find whats causing the error, please visit our forums or
       our IRC Support channel for assistance.

       Some Anope modules require third party libraries, such as m_mysql and
       m_ssl. If these libraries are installed in nonstandard locations, cmake
       will probably not find them and should be told where they are by passing
       additional search paths to the last question in Config, such as:

       -DEXTRA_INCLUDES:STRING=c:/openssl/include;c:/openssl/lib

       Which would have cmake search both C:\openssl\include and
       C:\openssl\lib.

       Building Anope with gettext requires libintl, libiconv, libgcc and
       libmingex. We have precompiled these libraries for you that you may
       use if you want. They are avaiable at http://anope.org/downloads/anope-extra.zip
       The OpenSSL, MySQL, and OpenLDAP header files and libraries are also included in
       this package. Once downloaded and extracted, you should run install.bat
       then give Config the path to the new 'installed' directory.

    5) You are now ready to compile. If you said you wanted to use NMake in step 4,
       at the prompt type:

        nmake

       Once you are back at the command prompt again, if there have been no
       errors, you are ready to go.

       If instead you decided to use the Visual C++ IDE, open up the Anope.sln
       file. After the IDE has fully loaded, hit F7 to build everything.

       Should you encounter errors with the installation process, check the
       messages displayed for advice on resolving them. If you are unable to
       resolve the issues yourself, seek assistance on our forums or in our
       IRC Support channel.

    6) Finally you will need to install Anope. If you said you wanted to use NMake
       in step 4, at the prompt type:

        nmake install

       Otherwise, if you decided to use the Visual C++ IDE, find the project called
       INSTALL within the Solution Explorer. Right-click on INSTALL and choose Build.

       When you have done this, all the files will be installed to where they belong.
       The only thing you need to do is rename "data/example.conf" to be "data/services.conf",
       and then follow the steps to set up Anope.

    You have now completed the building phase of Anope for Windows. You can
    now move on to the next section, which is related to setting up Anope.

2) Installation

    Since Anope for Windows does not use a visual interface, you must do the
    configuration with a text editor before proceeding with running Anope
    itself.

    NOTE: You may need to open the configuration file with Wordpad, or a text
    editor which supports UNIX line endings. Opening the configuration file in
    Notepad will cause strange characters to appear, and you may not be able to
    edit the file correctly.

    Open services.conf, and read through it carefully and adjust the settings
    you think you need to adjust.

    If you are unsure of the settings, you can go to the dos command prompt
    and run "anope.exe --nofork --debug" and watch the information as it
    attempts to connect.

    You can launch services in two ways. If you are sure that the entered
    configuration information is correct, simply double clicking the Anope
    executable will cause it to start; no window will pop up. If you'd rather
    have a more textual output, you can start at the dos prompt and type in
    "anope.exe". If services are successfully started up the dos prompt will
    seem to hang; at this point you can safely close the dos window.

3) Compiling Modules

    If you want to build other modules than the ones shipped by default, you
    will need to rerun Config.exe

4) Other compile options

    A) If you have trouble recompiling Anope, you should delete all files and folders
       within the build folder you created in step 3 of section 1. Afterwards, follow
       the directions from step 4 of section 1 down.
