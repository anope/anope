# United States English language file.
#
# (C) 2003-2013 Anope Team
# Contact us at team@anope.org
#   
# Please read COPYING and README for further details.
#     
# Based on the original code of Epona by Lara.
# Based on the original code of Services by Andy Church. 
#
# When translating this file to another language, keep in mind that the
# order of parameters for sprintf() is fixed in the source code, so your
# messages need to take the same parameters in the same order as the
# English messages do.  (Obviously, this doesn't hold for the strftime()
# format lines immediately below.)  If you can't get a natural translation
# of a message without changing the order of the parameters, let us know
# (team@anope.org) which message is causing a problem and I'll see
# what I can do.
#
# In help messages, "%S" (capital S, not lowercase) refers to the name of
# the service sending the message; for example, in NickServ help messages,
# "%S" is replaced by "NickServ" (or whatever it is renamed to in
# services.conf).  The %S's do not count as sprintf() parameters, so they can be
# rearranged, removed, or added as necessary.
#
# Also in help messages, please try to limit line lengths to 60 characters
# of text (not including the leading tab).  This length was chosen because
# it does not cause line wrap under default settings on most current IRC
# clients.  Remember that format characters (control-B, control-_) are not
# included in that 60-character limit (since they don't show on the user's
# screen).  Also remember that format specifiers (%S, etc.) will expand
# when displayed, so remember to take this into account; you can assume
# that the length of a pseudoclient name (%S replacement) will be eight
# characters, so reduce the maximum line length by 6 for every %S on a
# line.
#
# Finally, remember to put a tab at the beginning of every line of text
# (including empty lines).  This has to be a tab, not spaces.

# strftime() format strings.  man 3 strftime for information on the
# meanings of the format specifiers.  Short version:
#	%a = weekday name (short)	%H = hour
#	%b = month name (short)		%M = minute
#	%d = day of month		%S = second
#	%Y = year			%Z = time zone

# This is used as the format string for strftime() for a date and time
# together.
STRFTIME_DATE_TIME_FORMAT
	%b %d %H:%M:%S %Y %Z
# This is used as the format string for strftime() for a date alone in long
# format (English: including weekday).
STRFTIME_LONG_DATE_FORMAT
	%a %b %d %Y
# This is used as the format string for strftime() for a date alone in
# short format (English: without weekday).
STRFTIME_SHORT_DATE_FORMAT
	%b %d %Y

# These tell our strftime() what the names of months and days are.  If you
# don't use %a, %A, %b, or %B in your strftime() strings above, you can
# leave these empty.  However, if you enter names, they MUST stay in order,
# one per line, and the list MUST be complete!

# EXCEPTION help

OPER_HELP_EXCEPTION
	Syntax: EXCEPTION ADD [+expiry] mask limit reason
	        EXCEPTION DEL {mask | list}
	        EXCEPTION MOVE num position
	        EXCEPTION LIST [mask | list]
	        EXCEPTION VIEW [mask | list]
	
	Allows Services admins to manipulate the list of hosts that
	have specific session limits - allowing certain machines, 
	such as shell servers, to carry more than the default number
	of clients at a time. Once a host reaches it's session limit,
	all clients attempting to connect from that host will be
	killed. Before the user is killed, they are notified, via a
	/NOTICE from %S, of a source of help regarding session
	limiting. The content of this notice is a config setting.
	
	EXCEPTION ADD adds the given host mask to the exception list.
	Note that nick!user@host and user@host masks are invalid!
	Only real host masks, such as box.host.dom and *.host.dom,
	are allowed because sessions limiting does not take nick or
	user names into account. limit must be a number greater than
	or equal to zero. This determines how many sessions this host
	may carry at a time. A value of zero means the host has an
	unlimited session limit. See the AKILL help for details about
	the format of the optional expiry parameter.
	EXCEPTION DEL removes the given mask from the exception list.
	EXCEPTION MOVE moves exception num to position. The
	exceptions inbetween will be shifted up or down to fill the gap.
	EXCEPTION LIST and EXCEPTION VIEW show all current
	exceptions; if the optional mask is given, the list is limited
	to those exceptions matching the mask. The difference is that
	EXCEPTION VIEW is more verbose, displaying the name of the
	person who added the exception, it's session limit, reason, 
	host mask and the expiry date and time.
	
	Note that a connecting client will "use" the first exception
	their host matches. Large exception lists and widely matching
	exception masks are likely to degrade services' performance.

OPER_HELP_SESSION
	Syntax: SESSION LIST threshold
	        SESSION VIEW host
	
	Allows Services admins to view the session list.

	SESSION LIST lists hosts with at least threshold sessions.
	The threshold must be a number greater than 1. This is to 
	prevent accidental listing of the large number of single 
	session hosts.
	SESSION VIEW displays detailed information about a specific
	host - including the current session count and session limit.
	The host value may not include wildcards.

	See the EXCEPTION help for more information about session
	limiting and how to set session limits specific to certain
	hosts and groups thereof.

OPER_HELP_STAFF
	Syntax: STAFF

	Displays all Services Staff nicks along with level
	and on-line status.

OPER_HELP_DEFCON
	Syntax: DEFCON [1|2|3|4|5]

	The defcon system can be used to implement a pre-defined
	set of restrictions to services useful during an attempted
	attack on the network.

OPER_HELP_CHANKILL
	Syntax: CHANKILL [+expiry] channel reason

	Puts an AKILL for every nick on the specified channel. It
	uses the entire and complete real ident@host for every nick,
	then enforces the AKILL.

NICK_HELP
	%S allows you to "register" a nickname and
	prevent others from using it. The following
	commands allow for registration and maintenance of
	nicknames; to use them, type %R%S command.
	For more information on a specific command, type
	%R%S HELP command.
	
	
NICK_HELP_FOOTER
	 
	NOTICE: This service is intended to provide a way for
	IRC users to ensure their identity is not compromised.
	It is NOT intended to facilitate "stealing" of
	nicknames or other malicious actions.  Abuse of %S
	will result in, at minimum, loss of the abused
	nickname(s).
	
NICK_HELP_EXPIRES
	
	Nicknames that are not used anymore are subject to 
	the automatic expiration, i.e. they will be deleted
	after %d days if not used.

NICK_HELP_REGISTER
	Syntax: REGISTER password [email]
	
	Registers your nickname in the %S database.  Once
	your nick is registered, you can use the SET and ACCESS
	commands to configure your nick's settings as you like
	them.  Make sure you remember the password you use when
	registering - you'll need it to make changes to your nick
	later.  (Note that case matters!  ANOPE, Anope, and 
	anope are all different passwords!)
	
	Guidelines on choosing passwords:
	
	Passwords should not be easily guessable.  For example,
	using your real name as a password is a bad idea.  Using
	your nickname as a password is a much worse idea ;) and,
	in fact, %S will not allow it.  Also, short
	passwords are vulnerable to trial-and-error searches, so
	you should choose a password at least 5 characters long.
	Finally, the space character cannot be used in passwords.
	
	The parameter email is optional and will set the email
	for your nick immediately. However, it may be required
	on certain networks.
	Your privacy is respected; this e-mail won't be given to
	any third-party person.
	
	This command also creates a new group for your nickname,
	that will allow you to register other nicks later sharing
	the same configuration, the same set of memos and the
	same channel privileges. For more information on this
	feature, type %R%S HELP GROUP.
	
NICK_HELP_GROUP
	Syntax: GROUP target password
	
	This command makes your nickname join the target nickname's 
	group. password is the password of the target nickname.
	
	Joining a group will allow you to share your configuration,
	memos, and channel privileges with all the nicknames in the
	group, and much more!
	 
	A group exists as long as it is useful. This means that even
	if a nick of the group is dropped, you won't lose the
	shared things described above, as long as there is at
	least one nick remaining in the group.
	
	You can use this command even if you have not registered
	your nick yet. If your nick is already registered, you'll
	need to identify yourself before using this command. Type
	%R%S HELP IDENTIFY for more information. This
	last may be not possible on your IRC network.
	
	It is recommended to use this command with a non-registered
	nick because it will be registered automatically when 
	using this command. You may use it with a registered nick (to 
	change your group) only if your network administrators allowed 
	it.
	
	You can only be in one group at a time. Group merging is
	not possible.
	
	Note: all the nicknames of a group have the same password.

NICK_HELP_IDENTIFY
	Syntax: IDENTIFY password
	
	Tells %S that you are really the owner of this
	nick.  Many commands require you to authenticate yourself
	with this command before you use them.  The password
	should be the same one you sent with the REGISTER
	command.

NICK_HELP_UPDATE
	Syntax: UPDATE

	Updates your current status, i.e. it checks for new memos,
	sets needed chanmodes (ModeonID) and updates your vhost and
	your userflags (lastseentime, etc).
	
NICK_HELP_LOGOUT
	Syntax: LOGOUT
	
	This reverses the effect of the IDENTIFY command, i.e.
	make you not recognized as the real owner of the nick
	anymore. Note, however, that you won't be asked to reidentify
	yourself.

NICK_HELP_DROP
	Syntax: DROP [nickname]
	
	Drops your nickname from the %S database.  A nick
	that has been dropped is free for anyone to re-register.
	
	You may drop a nick within your group by passing it
	as the nick parameter.
	
	In order to use this command, you must first identify
	with your password (%R%S HELP IDENTIFY for more
	information).

NICK_HELP_ACCESS
	Syntax: ACCESS ADD mask
	        ACCESS DEL mask
	        ACCESS LIST
	
	Modifies or displays the access list for your nick.  This
	is the list of addresses which will be automatically
	recognized by %S as allowed to use the nick.  If
	you want to use the nick from a different address, you
	need to send an IDENTIFY command to make %S
	recognize you.
	
	Examples:
	
	    ACCESS ADD anyone@*.bepeg.com
	        Allows access to user anyone from any machine in
	        the bepeg.com domain.
	
	    ACCESS DEL anyone@*.bepeg.com
	        Reverses the previous command.
	
	    ACCESS LIST
	        Displays the current access list.

NICK_HELP_SET
	Syntax: SET option parameters
	
	Sets various nickname options.  option can be one of:
	
	    DISPLAY    Set the display of your group in Services
	    PASSWORD   Set your nickname password
	    LANGUAGE   Set the language Services will use when
	                   sending messages to you
	    URL        Associate a URL with your nickname
	    EMAIL      Associate an E-mail address with your nickname
	    ICQ        Associate an ICQ number with your nickname
	    GREET      Associate a greet message with your nickname
	    KILL       Turn protection on or off
	    SECURE     Turn nickname security on or off
	    PRIVATE    Prevent your nickname from appearing in a
	                   %R%S LIST
	    HIDE       Hide certain pieces of nickname information
	    MSG        Change the communication method of Services
	    AUTOOP     Should services op you automatically.    
	
	In order to use this command, you must first identify
	with your password (%R%S HELP IDENTIFY for more
	information).
	
	Type %R%S HELP SET option for more information
	on a specific option.

NICK_HELP_SET_DISPLAY
	Syntax: SET DISPLAY new-display
	
	Changes the display used to refer to your nickname group in 
	Services. The new display MUST be a nick of your group.

NICK_HELP_SET_PASSWORD
	Syntax: SET PASSWORD new-password
	
	Changes the password used to identify you as the nick's
	owner.

NICK_HELP_SET_LANGUAGE
	Syntax: SET LANGUAGE number
	
	Changes the language Services uses when sending messages to
	you (for example, when responding to a command you send).
	number should be chosen from the following list of
	supported languages:
	

NICK_HELP_SET_URL
	Syntax: SET URL url
	
	Associates the given URL with your nickname.  This URL
	will be displayed whenever someone requests information
	on your nick with the INFO command.

NICK_HELP_SET_EMAIL
	Syntax: SET EMAIL address

NICK_HELP_RECOVER
	Syntax: RECOVER nickname [password]
	
	Allows you to recover your nickname if someone else has
	taken it; this does the same thing that %S does
	automatically if someone tries to use a kill-protected
	nick.
	
	When you give this command, %S will bring a fake
	user online with the same nickname as the user you're
	trying to recover your nick from.  This causes the IRC
	servers to disconnect the other user.  This fake user will
	remain online for %s to ensure that the other
	user does not immediately reconnect; after that time, you
	can reclaim your nick.  Alternatively, use the RELEASE
	command (%R%S HELP RELEASE) to get the nick
	back sooner.
	
	In order to use the RECOVER command for a nick, your

	this command gets rid of them sooner.
	
	In order to use the RELEASE command for a nick, your
	current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick's
	access list, you must be identified and in the group of
	that nick, or you must supply the correct password for
	the nickname.

NICK_HELP_GHOST
	Syntax: GHOST nickname [password]
	
	Terminates a "ghost" IRC session using your nick.  A
	"ghost" session is one which is not actually connected,
	but which the IRC server believes is still online for one
	reason or another.  Typically, this happens if your
	computer crashes or your Internet or modem connection
	goes down while you're on IRC.
	
	In order to use the GHOST command for a nick, your
	current address as shown in /WHOIS must be on that nick's

NICK_HELP_ALIST
	Syntax: ALIST [level]

	where nickname is the nickname sent with the command, and
	status-code is one of the following:
	
	    0 - no such user online or nickname not registered
	    1 - user not recognized as nickname's owner
	    2 - user recognized as owner via access list only
	    3 - user recognized as owner via password identification

	(i.e. which no user on the channel's access list enters
	for that period of time) will be automatically dropped.

CHAN_HELP_REGISTER
	Syntax: REGISTER channel password description
	
	Registers a channel in the %S database.  In order
	to use this command, you must first be a channel operator
	on the channel you're trying to register.  The password
	is used with the IDENTIFY command to allow others to
	make changes to the channel settings at a later time.
	The last parameter, which must be included, is a
	general description of the channel's purpose.
	
	When you register a channel, you are recorded as the
	"founder" of the channel.  The channel founder is allowed
	to change all of the channel settings for the channel;
	%S will also automatically give the founder
	channel-operator privileges when s/he enters the channel.
	See the ACCESS command (%R%S HELP ACCESS) for
	information on giving a subset of these privileges to
	other channel users.

CHAN_HELP_LOGOUT
	Syntax: LOGOUT channel nickname

CHAN_HELP_SET_FOUNDER
	Syntax: SET channel FOUNDER nick
	
	Changes the founder of a channel.  The new nickname must
	be a registered one.

CHAN_HELP_SET_SUCCESSOR
	Syntax: SET channel SUCCESSOR nick
	
	Changes the successor of a channel.  If the founder's
	nickname expires or is dropped while the channel is still
	registered, the successor will become the new founder of the
	channel.  However, if the successor already has too many
	channels registered (%d), the channel will be dropped
	instead, just as if no successor had been set.  The new
	nickname must be a registered one.

CHAN_HELP_SET_PASSWORD
	Syntax: SET channel PASSWORD password
	
	Sets the password used to identify as the founder of the
	channel.

CHAN_HELP_SET_DESC
	Syntax: SET channel DESC description
	
	Sets the description for the channel, which shows up with
	the LIST and INFO commands.

CHAN_HELP_SET_URL
	Syntax: SET channel URL [url]
	
	Associates the given URL with the channel.  This URL will
	be displayed whenever someone requests information on the
	channel with the INFO command.  If no parameter is given,
	deletes any current URL for the channel.

CHAN_HELP_SET_EMAIL
	Syntax: SET channel EMAIL [address]
	
	Associates the given E-mail address with the channel.
	This address will be displayed whenever someone requests
	information on the channel with the INFO command.  If no
	parameter is given, deletes any current E-mail address for
	the channel.

CHAN_HELP_SET_ENTRYMSG
	Syntax: SET channel ENTRYMSG [message]
	
	Sets the message which will be sent via /notice to users
	when they enter the channel.  If no parameter is given,
	causes no message to be sent upon entering the channel.

CHAN_HELP_SET_BANTYPE
	Syntax: SET channel BANTYPE bantype
	
	Sets the ban type that will be used by services whenever
	they need to ban someone from your channel.
	
	bantype is a number between 0 and 3 that means:
	
	0: ban in the form *!user@host
	1: ban in the form *!*user@host
	2: ban in the form *!*@host
	3: ban in the form *!*user@*.domain

CHAN_HELP_SET_KEEPTOPIC
	Syntax: SET channel KEEPTOPIC {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables the topic retention option for a
	channel.  When topic retention is set, the topic for the
	channel will be remembered by %S even after the
	last user leaves the channel, and will be restored the
	next time the channel is created.

CHAN_HELP_SET_TOPICLOCK
	Syntax: SET channel TOPICLOCK {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables the topic lock option for a channel.
	When topic lock is set, %S will not allow the
	channel topic to be changed except via the TOPIC
	command.

CHAN_HELP_SET_MLOCK
	Syntax: SET channel MLOCK modes
	
	Sets the mode-lock parameter for the channel. %S
	allows you to define certain channel modes to be always
	on, off or free to be either on or off.
	
	The modes parameter is constructed exactly the same way 
	as a /MODE command; that is, modes followed by a + are 
	locked on, and modes followed by a - are locked off. Note,
	however, that unlike the /MODE command, each use of
	SET MLOCK will remove all modes previously locked before
	setting the new!
	
	Warning:  If you set a mode-locked key, as in the second
	example below, you should also set the RESTRICTED option for
	the channel (see HELP SET RESTRICTED), or anyone entering
	the channel when it is empty will be able to see the key!
	
	Examples:
	
	    SET #channel MLOCK +nt-iklps
	        Forces modes n and t on, and modes i, k, l, p, and
	        s off.  Mode m is left free to be either on or off.
	
	    SET #channel MLOCK +knst-ilmp my-key
	        Forces modes k, n, s, and t on, and modes i, l, m,
	        and p off.  Also forces the channel key to be
	        "my-key".
	
	    SET #channel MLOCK +
	        Removes the mode lock; all channel modes are free
	        to be either on or off.

CHAN_HELP_SET_PEACE
	Syntax: SET channel PEACE {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables the peace option for a channel.
	When peace is set, a user won't be able to kick,
	ban or remove a channel status of a user that has
	a level superior or equal to his via %S commands.

CHAN_HELP_SET_PRIVATE
	Syntax: SET channel PRIVATE {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables the private option for a channel.
	When private is set, a %R%S LIST will not
	include the channel in any lists.

CHAN_HELP_SET_RESTRICTED
	Syntax: SET channel RESTRICTED {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables the restricted access option for a
	channel.  When restricted access is set, users not on
	the access list will instead be kicked and banned from the channel.

CHAN_HELP_SET_SECURE
	Syntax: SET channel SECURE {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables %S's security features for a
	channel.  When SECURE is set, only users who have
	registered their nicknames with %s and IDENTIFY'd
	with their password will be given access to the channel
	as controlled by the access list.

CHAN_HELP_SET_SECUREOPS
	Syntax: SET channel SECUREOPS {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables the secure ops option for a channel.
	When secure ops is set, users who are not on the userlist
	will not be allowed chanop status.
	
CHAN_HELP_SET_SECUREFOUNDER
	Syntax: SET channel SECUREFOUNDER {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables the secure founder option for a channel.
	When secure founder is set, only the real founder will be
	able to drop the channel, change its password, its founder and its
	successor, and not those who are IDENTIFY'd with %S.
	
CHAN_HELP_SET_SIGNKICK
	Syntax: SET channel SIGNKICK {ON | LEVEL | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables signed kicks for a
	channel.  When SIGNKICK is set, kicks issued with
	%S KICK command will have the nick that used the
	command in their reason.
	
	If you use LEVEL, those who have a level that is superior 
	or equal to the SIGNKICK level on the channel won't have their 
	kicks signed. See %R%S HELP LEVELS for more information. 

CHAN_HELP_SET_XOP
	Syntax: SET channel XOP {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables the xOP lists system for a channel.
	When XOP is set, you have to use the AOP/SOP/VOP
	commands in order to give channel privileges to
	users, else you have to use the ACCESS command.
	
	Technical Note: when you switch from access list to xOP 
	lists system, your level definitions and user levels will be
	changed, so you won't find the same values if you
	switch back to access system! 
	
	You should also check that your users are in the good xOP 
	list after the switch from access to xOP lists, because the 
	guess is not always perfect... in fact, it is not recommended 
	to use the xOP lists if you changed level definitions with 
	the LEVELS command.
	
	Switching from xOP lists system to access list system
	causes no problem though.

CHAN_HELP_SET_OPNOTICE
	Syntax: SET channel OPNOTICE {ON | OFF}
	
	Enables or disables the op-notice option for a channel.
	When op-notice is set, %S will send a notice to the
	channel whenever the OP or DEOP commands are used for a user
	in the channel.

CHAN_HELP_AOP
	Syntax: AOP channel ADD nick
	        AOP channel DEL {nick | entry-num | list}
	        AOP channel LIST [mask | list]
	        AOP channel CLEAR
	
	Maintains the AOP (AutoOP) list for a channel. The AOP 
	list gives users the right to be auto-opped on your channel,
	to unban or invite themselves if needed, to have their
	greet message showed on join, and so on.
	
	The AOP ADD command adds the given nickname to the
	AOP list.
	
	The AOP DEL command removes the given nick from the
	AOP list.  If a list of entry numbers is given, those
	entries are deleted.  (See the example for LIST below.)
	
	The AOP LIST command displays the AOP list.  If
	a wildcard mask is given, only those entries matching the
	mask are displayed.  If a list of entry numbers is given,
	only those entries are shown; for example:

	   AOP #channel LIST 2-5,7-9
	      Lists AOP entries numbered 2 through 5 and
	      7 through 9.
	      
	The AOP CLEAR command clears all entries of the
	AOP list.
	
	The AOP ADD and AOP DEL commands are limited to
	SOPs or above, while the AOP CLEAR command can only
	be used by the channel founder. However, any user on the
	AOP list may use the AOP LIST command.
	
	This command may have been disabled for your channel, and
	in that case you need to use the access list. See 
	%R%S HELP ACCESS for information about the access list,
	and %R%S HELP SET XOP to know how to toggle between 
	the access list and xOP list systems.

CHAN_HELP_HOP
	Syntax: HOP channel ADD nick
	        HOP channel DEL {nick | entry-num | list}
	        HOP channel LIST [mask | list]
	        HOP channel CLEAR
	
	Maintains the HOP (HalfOP) list for a channel. The HOP 
	list gives users the right to be auto-halfopped on your 
	channel.
	
	The HOP ADD command adds the given nickname to the
	HOP list.
	
	The HOP DEL command removes the given nick from the
	HOP list.  If a list of entry numbers is given, those
	entries are deleted.  (See the example for LIST below.)
	
	The HOP LIST command displays the HOP list.  If
	a wildcard mask is given, only those entries matching the
	mask are displayed.  If a list of entry numbers is given,
	only those entries are shown; for example:

	   HOP #channel LIST 2-5,7-9
	      Lists HOP entries numbered 2 through 5 and
	      7 through 9.
	      
	The HOP CLEAR command clears all entries of the
	HOP list.
	
	The HOP ADD, HOP DEL and HOP LIST commands are 
	limited to AOPs or above, while the HOP CLEAR command 
	can only be used by the channel founder.
	
	This command may have been disabled for your channel, and
	in that case you need to use the access list. See 
	%R%S HELP ACCESS for information about the access list,
	and %R%S HELP SET XOP to know how to toggle between 
	the access list and xOP list systems.

CHAN_HELP_SOP
	Syntax: SOP channel ADD nick
	        SOP channel DEL {nick | entry-num | list}
	        SOP channel LIST [mask | list]
	        SOP channel CLEAR
	
	Maintains the SOP (SuperOP) list for a channel. The SOP 
	list gives users all rights given by the AOP list, and adds
	those needed to use the AutoKick and the BadWords lists, 
	to send and read channel memos, and so on.
	
	The SOP ADD command adds the given nickname to the
	SOP list.
	
	The SOP DEL command removes the given nick from the
	SOP list.  If a list of entry numbers is given, those
	entries are deleted.  (See the example for LIST below.)
	
	The SOP LIST command displays the SOP list.  If
	a wildcard mask is given, only those entries matching the
	mask are displayed.  If a list of entry numbers is given,
	only those entries are shown; for example:

	   SOP #channel LIST 2-5,7-9
	      Lists AOP entries numbered 2 through 5 and
	      7 through 9.
	      
	The SOP CLEAR command clears all entries of the
	SOP list.
	
	The SOP ADD, SOP DEL and SOP CLEAR commands are 
	limited to the channel founder. However, any user on the
	AOP list may use the SOP LIST command.
	
	This command may have been disabled for your channel, and
	in that case you need to use the access list. See 
	%R%S HELP ACCESS for information about the access list,
	and %R%S HELP SET XOP to know how to toggle between 
	the access list and xOP list systems.

CHAN_HELP_VOP
	Syntax: VOP channel ADD nick
	        VOP channel DEL {nick | entry-num | list}
	        VOP channel LIST [mask | list]
	        VOP channel CLEAR
	
	Maintains the VOP (VOicePeople) list for a channel.  
	The VOP list allows users to be auto-voiced and to voice 
	themselves if they aren't.
	
	The VOP ADD command adds the given nickname to the
	VOP list.

	The VOP LIST command displays the VOP list.  If
	a wildcard mask is given, only those entries matching the
	mask are displayed.  If a list of entry numbers is given,
	only those entries are shown; for example:

	   VOP #channel LIST 2-5,7-9
	      Lists VOP entries numbered 2 through 5 and
	      7 through 9.
	      
	The VOP CLEAR command clears all entries of the
	VOP list.
	
	The VOP ADD, VOP DEL and VOP LIST commands are 
	limited to AOPs or above, while the VOP CLEAR command 
	can only be used by the channel founder.
	
	This command may have been disabled for your channel, and
	in that case you need to use the access list. See 
	%R%S HELP ACCESS for information about the access list,
	and %R%S HELP SET XOP to know how to toggle between 
	the access list and xOP list systems.

CHAN_HELP_ACCESS
	Syntax: ACCESS channel ADD nick level
	        ACCESS channel DEL {nick | entry-num | list}
	        ACCESS channel LIST [mask | list]
	        ACCESS channel CLEAR
	
	Maintains the access list for a channel.  The access
	list specifies which users are allowed chanop status or
	access to %S commands on the channel.  Different
	user levels allow for access to different subsets of
	privileges; %R%S HELP ACCESS LEVELS for more
	specific information.  Any nick not on the access list has
	a user level of 0.
	
	The ACCESS ADD command adds the given nickname to the
	access list with the given user level; if the nick is
	already present on the list, its access level is changed to
	the level specified in the command.  The level specified
	must be less than that of the user giving the command, and
	if the nick is already on the access list, the current
	access level of that nick must be less than the access level
	of the user giving the command.
	
	The ACCESS DEL command removes the given nick from the
	access list.  If a list of entry numbers is given, those
	entries are deleted.  (See the example for LIST below.)
	
	The ACCESS LIST command displays the access list.  If
	a wildcard mask is given, only those entries matching the
	mask are displayed.  If a list of entry numbers is given,
	only those entries are shown; for example:

	   ACCESS #channel LIST 2-5,7-9
	      Lists access entries numbered 2 through 5 and
	      7 through 9.
	      
	The ACCESS CLEAR command clears all entries of the
	access list.

CHAN_HELP_ACCESS_LEVELS
	User access levels
	
	By default, the following access levels are defined:
	
	   Founder   Full access to %S functions; automatic
	                     opping upon entering channel.  Note
	                     that only one person may have founder
	                     status (it cannot be given using the
	                     ACCESS command).
	        10   Access to AKICK command; automatic opping.
	         5   Automatic opping.
	         3   Automatic voicing.
	         0   No special privileges; can be opped by other
	                     ops (unless secure-ops is set).
	        <0   May not be opped.
	
	These levels may be changed, or new ones added, using the
	LEVELS command; type %R%S HELP LEVELS for
	information.

CHAN_HELP_AKICK
	Syntax: AKICK channel ADD {nick | mask} [reason]
	        AKICK channel STICK mask
	        AKICK channel UNSTICK mask
	        AKICK channel DEL {nick | mask | entry-num | list}
	        AKICK channel LIST [mask | entry-num | list]
	        AKICK channel VIEW [mask | entry-num | list]
	        AKICK channel ENFORCE
	        AKICK channel CLEAR
	
	Maintains the AutoKick list for a channel.  If a user
	on the AutoKick list attempts to join the channel,
	%S will ban that user from the channel, then kick
	the user.
	
	The AKICK ADD command adds the given nick or usermask
	to the AutoKick list.  If a reason is given with
	the command, that reason will be used when the user is
	kicked; if not, the default reason is "You have been
	banned from the channel".
	When akicking a registered nick the nickserv account
	will be added to the akick list instead of the mask.
	All users within that nickgroup will then be akicked.
	
	The AKICK STICK command permanently bans the given mask 
	on the channel. If someone tries to remove the ban, %S
	will automatically set it again. You can't use it for
	registered nicks.
	
	The AKICK UNSTICK command cancels the effect of the
	AKICK STICK command, so you'll be able to unset the
	ban again on the channel.
	
	The AKICK DEL command removes the given nick or mask
	from the AutoKick list.  It does not, however, remove any
	bans placed by an AutoKick; those must be removed
	manually.
	
	The AKICK LIST command displays the AutoKick list, or
	optionally only those AutoKick entries which match the
	given mask.
	
	The AKICK VIEW command is a more verbose version of
	AKICK LIST command.
	
	The AKICK ENFORCE command causes %S to enforce the
	current AKICK list by removing those users who match an
	AKICK mask.
	
	The AKICK CLEAR command clears all entries of the
	akick list.

CHAN_HELP_LEVELS
	Syntax: LEVELS channel SET type level
	        LEVELS channel {DIS | DISABLE} type
	        LEVELS channel LIST
	        LEVELS channel RESET
	
	The LEVELS command allows fine control over the meaning of
	the numeric access levels used for channels.  With this
	command, you can define the access level required for most
	of %S's functions.  (The SET FOUNDER and SET PASSWORD
	commands, as well as this command, are always restricted to
	the channel founder.)
	
	LEVELS SET allows the access level for a function or group of
	functions to be changed.  LEVELS DISABLE (or DIS for short)
	disables an automatic feature or disallows access to a
	function by anyone other than the channel founder.
	LEVELS LIST shows the current levels for each function or
	group of functions.  LEVELS RESET resets the levels to the
	default levels of a newly-created channel (see
	HELP ACCESS LEVELS).
	
	For a list of the features and functions whose levels can be
	set, see HELP LEVELS DESC.

CHAN_HELP_LEVELS_DESC
	The following feature/function names are understood.  Note
	that the levels for AUTODEOP and NOJOIN are maximum levels,
	while all others are minimum levels.

CHAN_HELP_LEVELS_DESC_FORMAT
	    %-*s  %s

CHAN_HELP_INFO
	Syntax: INFO channel [ALL]
	
	Lists information about the named registered channel,
	including its founder, time of registration, last time
	used, description, and mode lock, if any. If ALL is 
	specified, the entry message and successor will also 
	be displayed.
	
	By default, the ALL option is limited to those with
	founder access on the channel.

CHAN_HELP_LIST
	Syntax: LIST pattern
	
	Lists all registered channels matching the given pattern.
	(Channels with the PRIVATE option set are not listed.)
	Note that a preceding '#' specifies a range, channel names
	are to be written without '#'.

CHAN_HELP_OP
	Syntax: OP [#channel [nick]]
	
	Ops a selected nick on a channel. If nick is not given,
	it will op you. If channel and nick are not given,

	have the rights to.
	
	By default, limited to AOPs or those with level 5 access 
	and above on the channel.

CHAN_HELP_DEOP
	Syntax: DEOP [#channel [nick]]
	
	Deops a selected nick on a channel. If nick is not given,
	it will deop you. If channel and nick are not given,

	have the rights to.
	
	By default, limited to AOPs or those with level 5 access 
	and above on the channel.
	
CHAN_HELP_VOICE
	Syntax: VOICE [#channel [nick]]
	
	Voices a selected nick on a channel. If nick is not given,
	it will voice you. If channel and nick are not given,
	it will voice you on all channels you're on, provided you
	have the rights to.
	
	By default, limited to AOPs or those with level 5 access 
	and above on the channel, or to VOPs or those with level 3 
	and above for self voicing.

	the time or not, or to channels(*).  Both the sender's
	nickname and the target nickname or channel must be
	registered in order to send a memo.

	above commands.

	(*) By default, any user with at least level 10 access on a
	    channel can read that channel's memos.  This can be
	    changed with the %s LEVELS command.

MEMO_HELP_SEND
	Syntax: SEND {nick | channel} memo-text
	
	Sends the named nick or channel a memo containing
	memo-text.  When sending to a nickname, the recipient will
	receive a notice that he/she has a new memo.  The target
	nickname/channel must be registered.
	
MEMO_HELP_CANCEL
	Syntax: CANCEL {nick | channel}
	
	Cancels the last memo you sent to the given nick or channel,
	provided it has not been read at the time you use the command.

MEMO_HELP_LIST
	Syntax: LIST [channel] [list | NEW]
	
	Lists any memos you currently have.  With NEW, lists only
	new (unread) memos.  Unread memos are marked with a "*"

	single number, as in the second example below.
	
	If LAST is given, the last memo will be deleted.
	If ALL is given, deletes all of your memos.
	
	Examples:
	
	   DEL 1
	      Deletes your first memo.
	
	   DEL 2-5,7-9
	      Deletes memos numbered 2 through 5 and 7 through 9.

MEMO_HELP_SET
	Syntax: SET option parameters

	Sets various memo options.  option can be one of:
	
	    NOTIFY      Changes when you will be notified about
	                    new memos (only for nicknames)
	    LIMIT       Sets the maximum number of memos you can
	                    receive
	
	Type %R%S HELP SET option for more information
	on a specific option.

MEMO_HELP_SET_NOTIFY
	Syntax: SET NOTIFY {ON | LOGON | NEW | MAIL | NOMAIL | OFF}

	Changes when you will be notified about new memos:
	
	    ON      You will be notified of memos when you log on,
	               when you unset /AWAY, and when they are sent
	               to you.
	    LOGON   You will only be notified of memos when you log
	               on or when you unset /AWAY.
	    NEW     You will only be notified of memos when they
	               are sent to you.
	    MAIL    You will be notified of memos by email aswell as
	               any other settings you have.
	    NOMAIL  You will not be notified of memos by email.
	    OFF     You will not receive any notification of memos.
	
	ON is essentially LOGON and NEW combined.

MEMO_HELP_SET_LIMIT
	Syntax: SET LIMIT [channel] limit
	
	Sets the maximum number of memos you (or the given channel)
	are allowed to have. If you set this to 0, no one will be
	able to send any memos to you.  However, you cannot set
	this any higher than %d.

MEMO_HELP_INFO
	Syntax: INFO [channel]
	
	Displays information on the number of memos you have, how
	many of them are unread, and how many total memos you can
	receive.  With a parameter, displays the same information
	for the given channel.

MEMO_SERVADMIN_HELP_SET_LIMIT
	Syntax: SET LIMIT [user | channel] {limit | NONE} [HARD]
	
	Sets the maximum number of memos a user or channel is
	allowed to have.  Setting the limit to 0 prevents the user
	from receiving any memos; setting it to NONE allows the
	user to receive and keep as many memos as they want.  If
	you do not give a nickname or channel, your own limit is
	set.
	
	Adding HARD prevents the user from changing the limit.  Not
	adding HARD has the opposite effect, allowing the user to
	change the limit (even if a previous limit was set with
	HARD).

	This use of the SET LIMIT command is limited to Services
	admins.  Other users may only enter a limit for themselves
	or a channel on which they have such privileges, may not
	remove their limit, may not set a limit above %d, and may
	not set a hard limit.

MEMO_SERVADMIN_HELP_INFO
	Syntax: INFO [nick | channel]

	Without a parameter, displays information on the number of
	memos you have, how many of them are unread, and how many
	total memos you can receive.
	
	With a channel parameter, displays the same information for
	the given channel.
	
	With a nickname parameter, displays the same information
	for the given nickname.  This use limited to Services
	admins.

MEMO_HELP_STAFF
	Syntax: STAFF memo-text

	Sends all services staff a memo containing memo-text.
	Note: If you have opers on both the oper list and the
	admin list they will receive the memo twice.  The same
	applies for oper's on the Root list as well as other
	lists.

MEMO_HELP_SENDALL
	Syntax: SENDALL memo-text

	Sends all registered users a memo containing memo-text.
	
MEMO_HELP_RSEND
	Syntax: RSEND {nick | channel} memo-text
	
	Sends the named nick or channel a memo containing
	memo-text.  When sending to a nickname, the recipient will
	receive a notice that he/she has a new memo.  The target
	nickname/channel must be registered.
	Once the memo is read by its recipient, an automatic notification
	memo will be sent to the sender informing him/her that the memo
	has been read.

MEMO_HELP_CHECK
	Syntax: CHECK nick
	
	Checks whether the _last_ memo you sent to nick has been read

	time format is seconds. You can specify it by using units.
	Valid units are: s for seconds, m for minutes, 
	h for hours and d for days. 
	Combinations of these units are not permitted.
	To make Services permanently ignore the	user, type 0 as time.
	When adding a mask, it should be in the format user@host
	or nick!user@host, everything else will be considered a nick.
	Wildcards are permitted.
	
	Ignores will not be enforced on IRC Operators.

	Parameters are the same as for the standard /MODE
	command.

OPER_HELP_OLINE
	Syntax: OLINE user flags
	
	Allows Super Admins to give Operflags to any user.

	        AKILL VIEW [mask | list]
	        AKILL CLEAR
	
	Allows Services operators to manipulate the AKILL list.  If
	a user matching an AKILL mask attempts to connect, Services
	will issue a KILL for that user and, on supported server
	types, will instruct all servers to add a ban (K-line) for
	the mask which the user matched.
	
	AKILL ADD adds the given user@host/ip mask to the AKILL
	list for the given reason (which must be given).
	expiry is specified as an integer followed by one of d 
	(days), h (hours), or m (minutes).  Combinations (such as 
	1h30m) are not permitted.  If a unit specifier is not 
	included, the default is days (so +30 by itself means 30 
	days).  To add an AKILL which does not expire, use +0.  If the
	usermask to be added starts with a +, an expiry time must
	be given, even if it is the same as the default.  The
	current AKILL default expiry time can be found with the
	STATS AKILL command.
	
	The AKILL DEL command removes the given mask from the
	AKILL list if it is present.  If a list of entry numbers is 
	given, those entries are deleted.  (See the example for LIST 
	below.)
	
	The AKILL LIST command displays the AKILL list.  
	If a wildcard mask is given, only those entries matching the
	mask are displayed.  If a list of entry numbers is given,
	only those entries are shown; for example:

	   AKILL LIST 2-5,7-9
	      Lists AKILL entries numbered 2 through 5 and 7 
	      through 9.
	      
	AKILL VIEW is a more verbose version of AKILL LIST, and 
	will show who added an AKILL, the date it was added, and when 
	it expires, as well as the user@host/ip mask and reason.
	
	AKILL CLEAR clears all entries of the AKILL list.

	        SGLINE VIEW [mask | list]
	        SGLINE CLEAR
	
	Allows Services operators to manipulate the SGLINE list.  If
	a user with a realname matching an SGLINE mask attempts to 
	connect, Services will not allow it to pursue his IRC
	session.
	
	SGLINE ADD adds the given realname mask to the SGLINE
	list for the given reason (which must be given).
	expiry is specified as an integer followed by one of d 
	(days), h (hours), or m (minutes).  Combinations (such as 
	1h30m) are not permitted.  If a unit specifier is not 
	included, the default is days (so +30 by itself means 30 
	days).  To add an SGLINE which does not expire, use +0.  If the
	realname mask to be added starts with a +, an expiry time must
	be given, even if it is the same as the default.  The
	current SGLINE default expiry time can be found with the
	STATS AKILL command.
	Note: because the realname mask may contain spaces, the
	separator between it and the reason is a colon.
	
	The SGLINE DEL command removes the given mask from the
	SGLINE list if it is present.  If a list of entry numbers is 
	given, those entries are deleted.  (See the example for LIST 
	below.)
	
	The SGLINE LIST command displays the SGLINE list.  
	If a wildcard mask is given, only those entries matching the

	        SQLINE VIEW [mask | list]
	        SQLINE CLEAR
	
	Allows Services operators to manipulate the SQLINE list.  If
	a user with a nick matching an SQLINE mask attempts to 
	connect, Services will not allow it to pursue his IRC
	session.

	If the first character of the mask is #, services will 
	prevent the use of matching channels (on IRCds that 
	support it).
	
	SQLINE ADD adds the given mask to the SQLINE
	list for the given reason (which must be given).
	expiry is specified as an integer followed by one of d 
	(days), h (hours), or m (minutes).  Combinations (such as 
	1h30m) are not permitted.  If a unit specifier is not

	      Lists SQLINE entries numbered 2 through 5 and 7 
	      through 9.
	      
	SQLINE VIEW is a more verbose version of SQLINE LIST, and 
	will show who added an SQLINE, the date it was added, and when 
	it expires, as well as the mask and reason.
	
	SQLINE CLEAR clears all entries of the SQLINE list.

OPER_HELP_SZLINE
	Syntax: SZLINE ADD [+expiry] mask reason
	        SZLINE DEL {mask | entry-num | list}
	        SZLINE LIST [mask | list]
	        SZLINE VIEW [mask | list]
	        SZLINE CLEAR
	
	Allows Services operators to manipulate the SZLINE list.  If
	a user with an IP matching an SZLINE mask attempts to 
	connect, Services will not allow it to pursue his IRC
	session (and this, whether the IP has a PTR RR or not).
	
	SZLINE ADD adds the given IP mask to the SZLINE
	list for the given reason (which must be given).
	expiry is specified as an integer followed by one of d 
	(days), h (hours), or m (minutes).  Combinations (such as 
	1h30m) are not permitted.  If a unit specifier is not 
	included, the default is days (so +30 by itself means 30 
	days).  To add an SZLINE which does not expire, use +0.  If the
	realname mask to be added starts with a +, an expiry time must
	be given, even if it is the same as the default.  The
	current SZLINE default expiry time can be found with the
	STATS AKILL command.
	
	The SZLINE DEL command removes the given mask from the
	SZLINE list if it is present.  If a list of entry numbers is 
	given, those entries are deleted.  (See the example for LIST 
	below.)
	
	The SZLINE LIST command displays the SZLINE list.  
	If a wildcard mask is given, only those entries matching the

	Sets read-only mode on or off.  In read-only mode, normal
	users will not be allowed to modify any Services data,
	including channel and nickname access lists, etc.  IRCops
	with sufficient Services privileges will be able to modify
	Services' AKILL list and drop or forbid nicknames and
	channels, but any such changes will not be saved unless
	read-only mode is deactivated before Services is terminated
	or restarted.
	
	This option is equivalent to the command-line option
	-readonly.

OPER_HELP_SET_LOGCHAN
	Syntax: SET LOGCHAN {ON | OFF}

	With this setting on, Services will send its logs to a specified
	channel as well as the log file. LogChannel must also be defined
	in the Services configuration file for this setting to be of any
	use.
	
	This option is equivalent to the command-line option -logchan.
	
	Note: This can have strong security implications if your log
	channel is not properly secured.

	to num.

	This option is equivalent to the command-line option
	-debug.

OPER_HELP_SET_NOEXPIRE
	Syntax: SET NOEXPIRE {ON | OFF}

	Sets no expire mode on or off.  In no expire mode, nicks,

	server and kill all IRCops currently on it to
	prevent them from rehashing the server (because this
	would just cancel the effect).

	NOOP REVOKE makes all removed O:lines available again
	on the given server.

	Note: The server is not checked at all by the
	Services.

OPER_HELP_JUPE
	Syntax: JUPE server [reason]
	
	Tells Services to jupiter a server -- that is, to create
	a fake "server" connected to Services which prevents
	the real server of that name from connecting.  The jupe
	may be removed using a standard SQUIT.  If a reason is
	given, it is placed in the server information field;
	otherwise, the server information field will contain the
	text "Juped by <nick>", showing the nickname of the
	person who jupitered the server.

OPER_HELP_RAW
	Syntax: RAW text
	
	Sends a string of text directly to the server to which
	Services is connected.  This command has a very limited

	session limitation, etc.)

OPER_HELP_QUIT
	Syntax: QUIT
	
	Causes Services to do an immediate shutdown; databases are
	not saved.  This command should not be used unless
	damage to the in-memory copies of the databases is feared
	and they should not be saved.  For normal shutdowns, use the
	SHUTDOWN command.

OPER_HELP_SHUTDOWN
	Syntax: SHUTDOWN
	
	Causes Services to save all databases and then shut down.

OPER_HELP_RESTART
	Syntax: RESTART

	(i.e. exit and immediately re-run the executable).

OPER_HELP_CHANLIST
	Syntax: CHANLIST [{pattern | nick} [SECRET]]
	
	Lists all channels currently in use on the IRC network, whether they
	are registered or not.

	If pattern is given, lists only channels that match it. If a nickname
	is given, lists only the channels the user using it is on. If SECRET is
