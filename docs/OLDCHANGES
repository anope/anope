2001/09/07  Made ChanServ TOPIC be usable by services admins.

            files.

2001/08/08  A fix for UnrealIRCd NICK handling (sometimes sent
            with only 7 parameters ?! oh well).
            	Reported by Benjamin <benjamin@chat-solutions.org>
2001/08/07  In an attempt to make the configure script clearer,
            I added the DumpCore and NetworkDomain configuration

                Reported by SpiderWeb <Spider.Web@Laposte.net>

Epona Version 1.4.0
-------------------
2001/07/23  Added support for Ultimate 2.8x.
2001/07/23  Rewritten Unreal support entirely, using parts of
            the Sequana hostmasking support. Unreal is now
            officially supported again.
2001/07/21  Added modes field to OperServ CHANLIST command.
2001/07/21  Made NickServ/ChanServ FORBID change nick/clear
            the channel if it is currently used.
2001/07/21  Removed Ultimate 3.x support, since its development 
            has restarted. Cleanup of levels as well.
2001/07/20  Added ChanServ SET PEACE option.
2001/07/20  Added an INFO level for free consultation
            of /chanserv INFO #chan ALL.
2001/07/20  Optimized processing of non fantasy channel 
            messages.
2001/07/20  Modified some help string to make them reflect
            the truth.
2001/07/20  Added AOP/SOP/VOP commands to ChanServ (one of
            the most requested features, but far from being
            my favourite).
            You can't use both xOP and access lists at the
            same time, you have to choose between them via
            the new ChanServ SET XOP command.
            These are newbie-friendly commands, and 
            therefore should be enabled by default.
2001/07/20  Services admins can now use ACCESS ADD/DEL/CLEAR
            without having a level on the channel (please
            use this feature ethically =).
2001/07/19  Made lang/index generate automatically through
            Makefile.
2001/07/18  Removed the CSRestrictDelay directive in ChanServ,
            that is now useless due to the use of services
            timestamp, and was dangerous anyways.
2001/07/18  Removed the useless privilege for IRC operators that
            were never deopped automatically by ChanServ (by
            SECUREOPS or when they join an empty registered channel
            for example).
2001/07/18  Made OperServ JUPE send a SQUIT before introducing
            the juped server because of so many reported 
            crashes when people don't care. If you're using
            Bahamut, a better alternative to JUPE is to use
            SZLINE. ;)
2001/07/18  Made the LocalAddress directive actually work, it
            wasn't working even before Epona was born.
2001/07/18  Renamed ChanServ SET TOPIC to TOPIC so it can have a
            dedicated level, and added ChanServ BAN command.
2001/07/18  Added ChanServ AKICK STICK command.
2001/07/13  Added NSMaxAliases directive to limit the number of
            nicks in the same group.
2001/07/10  Finally fixed the BotServ HELP SET SYMBIOSIS bug (the
            message was cut =) -- this alone is worth the upgrade :P
2001/07/10  /me are now handled correctly by BotServ kickers (ie. the
            CTCP part is cut before processing the message).
                Reported by Benjamin <benjamin@chat-solutions.org>
2001/07/10  Used Bahamut new CAPAB NICKIP feature in the proxy scanner
            so it doesn't need to resolve the hostnames.
2001/07/08  Made some cleanup in proxy code.
2001/07/01  Rewritten OP/DEOP and other pairs in an easily extensible 
            way.
2001/06/30  Added OperServ SQLINE command. It will also support
            Bahamut channel SQLINEs. However, bahamut 1.4.27
            or later is required.
2001/06/29  You needed a registered nick to use the privileges
            given by ChanServ IDENTIFY, which is not the expected
            behaviour. Fixed.
2001/06/27  Changed stuff in configure for libpthread detection.
2001/06/27  Fixed a bug in BotServ UNASSIGN.
                Reported by lbr <lbr@langochat.net>
2001/06/26  Added BotServ SET PRIVATE option for bots that need
            to be oper-only.
                Suggested by a lot of people :P
2001/06/23  Added OperServ RANDOMNEWS.
                Suggested by lucas <lucas@langochat.net>
2001/06/21  Added the ability to set the default language for
            non/newly-registered users in services.conf.
2001/06/09  Rewritten do_sjoin so that it doesn't do useless things
            sometimes.
2001/05/20  Added more support for Sequana in do_nick().
2001/05/20  Changed stuff in do_sjoin to make it easily extensible.
2001/05/04  New more efficient channel modes handling.
2001/05/04  Changed whosends() to a macro.
2001/04/22  Fixed check_kick() not making ChanServ join the channel
            if empty with Bahamut.
2001/04/22  Fixed a bug that caused the existence of channels with
            no users in certain cases.
2001/04/06  Added support for services ids, allowing users to be
            automatically re-identified after a split. It also prevents
            the logon news to be resent for users that were already
            there before the split.
2001/04/06  Fixed a bug in NickServ that was not refreshing the last
            seen time after a nick change.
                Reported by Lucas <lucas@langochat.net>
2001/04/05  Faster is_oper().
2001/04/05  Improved the way the NICK command is handled with Bahamut, 
            it's now a LOT faster (and cleaner).
2001/04/05  Added ProxyAkillReason directive, and more information
            to some other proxy-related directives.
                Suggested by Yougli <Yougli@free.fr>
2001/04/05  Got rid of the usercount() function (should have been
            done for months but I was just too lazy/busy).
2001/02/24  More bugfixes in Sequana support.
2001/02/24  NickServ usermask is now updated when an user changes
            his nick to a nick from the same group.
2001/02/16  Fixed a bug in the Sequana support.
2001/02/16  Added configuration directives to specify what type of
            detection must be done by the proxy detector.
2001/02/16  NickServ now prevents users from trying too many invalid
            passwords for NickServ GROUP.
                Reported by Blaire <lisa-bot@lookat.org>
2001/02/16  Fixed OperServ HELP RELOAD that pointed to HELP UPDATE.
                Reported by Raynor <raynor@ministre.net>

            about SET DONTKICKOPS in the French language file.
                Reported by Night <Night04@netcourrier.com>
2001/02/09  More support for Sequana.
2001/02/09  Made the code compile without thread support (oops).
2001/02/09  Added support for Sequana IRCd.
2001/02/03  Changed the way bot greets are said.
2001/01/28  Made is_services_root faster. It is also now fully 
            group-compatible. is_services_admin and is_services_operator 
            have been optimized as well.
2001/01/25  SOCKS5 detector is now much more reliable.
2001/01/22  Made some fixes to the proxy detector.
2001/01/21  Added a full featured proxy detector (detects Wingate, 
            SOCKS4, SOCKS5, and even HTTP proxy!). It comes along with
            the CACHE command in OperServ, and several configuration
            directives.
2001/01/21  Made the KILLCLONES command available to Services operators.
2001/01/17  Made some cleanup to main.c, it's more readable now.

-------------------
2001/03/07  The Epona official IRC channel (for bug reports ONLY)
            is not on the Kewl IRC network anymore, it's now
            on irc.langochat.net (see the README for details). 
2001/03/07  Fixed bugs in NickServ ACCESS, SET, RECOVER, RELEASE,
            GHOST, GETPASS and SENDPASS that caused Epona to crash
            if they were used for forbidden nicks.
                Reported (for RECOVER/RELEASE/GHOST) by 
                Vernom <vernom@sistec.com.mx>.
2001/03/07  Fixed a bug in the turkish language file (damn, damn.)
                Reported by so much people that I was in fact
                flooded :P

Epona Version 1.3.4
-------------------
2001/01/27  Fixed the timed_update evil crash, and a big memory leak as
            a bonus. Another funny joke from Andy Church.
                Reported by many people, so I thank them all.
                I'd like also to say a special thank to Daniel Engel 
                <dane@zero.org> for his help in chasing this bug.

Epona Version 1.3.3

Epona Version 1.3.2

Epona Version 1.3.1
-------------------
2001/01/12  Updated mirror list in the INSTALL file.

                Reported by [Flop] <flop@oscfg.com>

Epona Version 1.3.0

            protection option.

2000/12/14  Oops.. DreamForge/Unreal support was dumping core.

2000/12/07  Cleanup of the FAQ file.
2000/12/07  Cleanup of README file. KnownBugs renamed to BUGS.

            English? ;)
2000/12/06  Added a crontab script.
2000/12/05  Added BSDef... configuration directives.
2000/12/05  Channels with a '@' in their name are not ignored by BotServ 
            anymore.
2000/12/05  Bots now correctly reply to channel pings.
2000/12/04  Added a database converter for ircservices-4.4. Deleted the

            configuration file with certain versions of glibc.
2000/12/03  Added CSDef... configuration directives.
2000/12/02  Deleted SET LEAVEOPS command from ChanServ, because it's

2000/12/02  Added CLIST command to ChanServ.
2000/12/02  Added more Wall... configuration directives.
2000/12/02  Added NOOP command to OperServ. 
2000/12/01  Corrected a little bug in the !seen command.
2000/12/01  Services now use SVSMODE #chan -b nick on Bahamut networks
            to unban an user, so they are now fully supporting the
            somewhat different Bahamut ban system. 
2000/12/01  AKILL ADD, SGLINE ADD and SZLINE ADD now can change the
            expiry time of an existing entry, but only if the new one
            is longer than the old one.
2000/11/30  NickServ GHOST, RECOVER and RELEASE now can be used without
            a password, as long as you are identified and in the group
            of the target nick.
2000/11/30  Enhanced documentation for NickServ REGISTER and GROUP
            commands.
2000/11/27  NickServ LIST does not hide the nicks that are in the
            group of the user issuing the command anymore if they have 
            SET PRIVATE ON. The same applies to usermasks and SET HIDE
            USERMASK.
2000/11/27  Added "remote" drop feature for nicks within the same 
            group of the user issuing the command.
2000/11/27  Channels in use cannot expire anymore. However, their last
            used time is still not updated while they're in use.
2000/11/27  Made some needed cleanup in config.h.
2000/11/26  Added BSGentleBWReason configuration directive.
                Suggested by ShadowMaster <ShadowMaster@Shadow-Realm.org>

                Reported by TataZ <tataz@thepentagon.com>
2000/11/24  Added NSNoGroupChange configuration directive. Its purpose
            is easy to guess I think. =)
2000/11/24  Deleted the obsolete HelpDir configuration directive.
2000/11/24  NSDisableLink not used anymore; deleting it.
2000/11/23  Few bugs of the new link system corrected.
2000/11/22  New link system that is more efficient -- I let you discover
            all the diffs! =) The GROUP, GLIST and SET DISPLAY commands 
            have been added to handle it.
            The LINK, UNLINK, and LISTLINKS commands were all deleted
            because they are not needed anymore.
            The NoSplitRecovery config setting has been deleted, it is
            always enabled now -- the code was buggy anyway.
            NSExpireMaster and NSExpireSlaves are now only one setting,
            NSExpire, like before, because there are no more master
            and slave nicks.
            During the conversion to the new system I corrected many bugs
            and weird things in the code (especially two memory leaks when
            freeing akick and nick structures). NickServ has now a faster
            hash list -- this will greatly help on large networks.
2000/11/22  Added SENDPASS to ChanServ help index.
2000/11/21  Moved changes from (irc)services to the Changes.old file, as the
            Changes file started to be really big.
2000/11/14  Corrected another bug during nick deletion... If a nick was founder
            of a channel and was also on the access list of the same channel -> 
            access list entry was not cleaned -> it crashed.
2000/11/12  Channel successors were not cleaned on nick deletion. Oh well.
2000/11/12  Linked nicks now have a working SET PRIVATE.
                Reported by garner <garner@voila.fr>
2000/11/11  Fixed some weird behaviour with certain compiler versions
            in ChanServ ACCESS and AKICK lists.
            Reported by lanxin <webmaster@nidenet.com>
2000/10/28  Corrected ChanServ behavior for resetting last used
            time. Was when someone was autoopped on JOIN before,
            is whenever someone from the ACCESS list uses the
            channel in any way now, because there are cases where
            nobody gets autoopped at all. 
2000/10/26  Added SGLINE and SZLINE commands to OperServ (works
            with latest Bahamut only).
2000/10/25  Rewritten the OperServ AKILL command code. There cannot
            be two times the same host anymore, and the command
            will check whether the added AKILLs are already covered
            by another or not. The bug in the AKILL wallops has
            been fixed as well.
            Additionally, AKILLs are now stocked in the OperServ
            database (not in a dedicated database anymore).
2000/10/23  Fixed OperServ RELOAD to make it reset all directives to 0
            before reloading the config file (when this was not done
            some settings were not reloaded correctly if not present).
2000/10/23  Corrected the problem that caused some services admins list
            entries to be "like a ghost" in wrong-way links.
2000/10/10  Corrected some weird behavior when unlinking from a nick.
2000/10/09  Changed the way channel user modes are handled, so it can
            be easily extended.
2000/10/06  Corrected some cosmetic problems in the language files.

Epona Version 1.2.6
-------------------
2000/12/13  Made ChanServ SET TOPIC work with Unreal.
2000/12/07  Fixed bugs in MemoServ when accessing memos from forbidden 
            channels.
                Reported by ZeRo K <zero@townsito.net> and others later.

Epona Version 1.2.5
-------------------
2000/11/06  For those who ask... Version 1.3.0 is currently being
            developped. Don't know when it will go out though, but
            probably in the beginning of December (no promises though).
            I know it's a long time to wait but.. I'm coding Epona
            during my free time that is not so huge currently. I know
            you want more and more new features, but doing something
            that does not crash every five minutes takes time for
            coding AND testing.

                Reported by Galak <thegalak@hotmail.com>
2000/08/19  Fixed a bug in automatic akill in session limiting code

2000/08/14  Added ChanServ SET SIGNKICK command.

2000/07/28  Changed the behavior of NickServ LISTLINKS ALL to also show
            the direct link of the nick being looked up. It looks like
            something usable now (finally ;).
2000/07/28  Forbidden channels cannot receive memos anymore.
2000/07/28  Forbidden nicknames cannot be set founder or successor

            handled. Although it's not totally finished yet

2000/07/25  Added ChanServ KICK command (with KICK and KICKME

2000/07/24  Restricted BotServ INFO #channel to founder
            and Services admins only (maybe should I
            think to implement a INFO level in the future?).
2000/07/14  Color kicker can now be used on Bahamut and 
            Unreal networks. Although there is a mode +c
            that *should* be used to prevent the use of
            colors on the channel, some users have noticed
            me that it does not make access level distinction.
            Too right. :)
2000/07/14  Added the !seen command to the fantaisist
            commands.

            passwords" kills.
2000/06/23  Networks that use Bahamut now need to use at least
            the version 1.4.3 for Epona to work fine.

2000/06/19  Corrected how MemoServ notifies online users of their
            new memos that failed in certain cases if MSNotifyAll
            is set. One more time, I'm asking myself how the heck
            the link support was coded.
                Reported by wezen <wezen@ifrance.com>
2000/06/18  Fixed another bug in SJOIN processing that affects only

            on big channels.

Epona Version 1.1.2
-------------------
2000/06/09  Added a 'For more info' notice in NickServ INFO.
            This was needed because of the huge changement introduced
            by the original Services maintainer. This
            will certainly be removed in a future release.
                Suggested by Lucas <lucas@ians.be>
2000/06/09  Bots are now stocked in a hash list (increased speed
            and alphabetical order in the list ;)

            work anymore for wildcard masks.
                Reported by Mars <mars@freemail.chatarea.net>
2000/05/29  Changed the behaviour of NickServ INFO in some ways,
            considering that nick options are only interesting
            for the nick owner (and services admin); also, the nick
            owner is now extended to the nick itself and its links.
            ChanServ INFO adopts the same rules, but for channel
            founder. Also, topic is not displayed anymore in INFO
            if the channel has the mode s locked or the channel
            is in +s mode.

            network) now uses Epona, with BotServ feature enabled - and
            it works fine! ;)
2000/05/25  Rewritten Bahamut SJOIN handling, runs faster now especially
            on large channels during a netjoin. Also it now works fine on

2000/05/23  Updated NickServ and ChanServ mem stats routines.
2000/05/23  BSSmartJoin improved: the bot (virtually) invites itself
            before joining when the channel is in +i mode or +l mode 
            if users limit has been reached.
2000/05/23  Services now remove the old Q line for a bot when its nick
            is changed.

            optional parameter email if this option is not enabled.

            between linked nicks.

2000/02/19  HelpServ rewritten, now delivering messages depending
            of users' language.
2000/02/19  Removed irciihelp, not very useful nowadays. Heck, every
            IRC clients are provided with an help file, so why
            must we serve one?
2000/02/19  NickServ now will always change nick instead of kill users
            -- since it is really more efficient.

            or official successors.
2000/02/19  Here starts the life of Epona. ;)
