Anope Internal Events

1) Intro
2) Using Events

1) Introduction to Internal Events

    Internal Events are setup to give module developers more information
    about what the core is doing at different times. This information can
    be as complex as data we are feeding to the uplink, to simple triggered
    events such as the databases being saved.

    Additionally there is a module included with the core
    which can provide some clue as to how to use the code in your modules.
    The rest of this document assumes that you are used to writing modules.

2) Using Events

    Each Event in Anope calls a function.
    You must override these functions in your main modules class.
    The full list of functions and parameters are in modules.h. In this
    case, you would be overriding OnJoinChannel() and OnPartChannel() like so:

    void OnJoinChannel(User *u, Channel *c) anope_override { }
    void OnPartChannel(User *u, Channel *c) anope_override { }

    Some of these event overrides can be used to prevent or allow things to
    happen that would normally not be allowed or denied. You can also use
    ModuleManager (not explained here) to set control which order the modules
    are queried (when multiple modules hook to the same event).

    The "anope_override" identifier is for compatibility with C++11.
    Its usage is highly recommended.
