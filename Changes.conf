** ADDED CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES **

###########################################################################
#
# DefCon configuration
#
###########################################################################
# DefConLevel <level> [OPTIONAL]
#     Default defcon level (1-5) to use when starting services up, level 5
#     instructs services to run as normal.

#DefConLevel 5

# DefCon1-4 <numeric> [REQUIRED if Defcon is activated]
#     These numercics determine which of the following operations take place
#     at each level, the correct numeric can be found by adding together the
#     number for each restriction you wish to place at a level.
#     No new channel registrations			1
#     No New Nick Registrations				2
#     No MLOCK changes 					4
#     Force Chan Mode					8
#     Use Reduced Session Limit				16
#     KILL any new clients trying to connect		32
#     Services will ignore everyone but opers		64
#     Services will silently ignore everyone but opers	128
#     AKILL all new clients trying to connect		256
#     No new memos sent to block memoserv attacks	512

#DefCon4 23
#     No channel reg + No Nick Reg + No MLOCK changes + Use Reduced Session Limit
#           1        +      2      +         4        +            16

#DefCon3 31
#     As DefCon4 + Services will Force Chan Mode's on channels
#          23    +                     8

#DefCon2 159
#     As DefCon3 + Services will silently ignore everyone but opers
#          32    +                    128

#DefCon1 415
#     As DefCon2 + AKILL all new clients trying to connect
#          159   +                  256

# DefConSessionLimit <limit> [REQUIRED if DefCon is activated]
#     New session limit to use when a defcon level is using "reduced"
#     session limiting.
#     NOTE: When using DefCon this value needs to be defined
#DefConSessionLimit 2

# DefConAkillExpire <time> [REQUIRED if DefCon is activated]
#     Length of time to add the AKILL for when DEFCON is preventing
#     all new clients from connecting to the network
#
#     NOTE: As with all expire times, the expirey check will only be
#     carried out once every "ExpireTimeout" so if this setting is
#     30m the the akill could last for 30m regardless of this setting.
#
#     NOTE: When using DefCon this value needs to be defined
#DefConAkillExpire 5m

# DefConChanModes <modes> [REQUIRED if DefCon is activated]
#     The channel modes to set on all channel's when the DefCon channel
#     mode system is in use.
#
#     NOTE: Choose these modes carefully, because when defcon switches to
#     a level which does NOT have the mode setting selected, services will
#     set the reverse on all channel's, e.g. if this setting is +RN
#     when defcon is used all channel's will be set to +RN, when
#     defcon is removed, channels will all be set to -RN. You don't
#     want to set this to +k for example because when defcon is removed all
#     channels will -k.
#     NOTE: mlock'ed modes will not be lost
#DefConChanModes "+R"

# DefConTimeOut <time> [OPTIONAL]
#     This value can be used to automaticaly return the network to
#     defcon 5 after the specified time period - just in case any opers
#     forget to remove a defcon setting.
#DefConTimeOut 15m

# GlobalOnDefcon [OPTIONAL]
#
#     Setting this directive will make Services send a global message on
#     Defcon Level changes.
#GlobalOnDefcon

# GlobalOnDefconMore [OPTIONAL]
#
#     Setting this directive will make Services send a global message on
#     Defcon Level changes. Uncommenting this will allow you to send along
#     with the new level, the DefconMessage.
#GlobalOnDefconMore

#DefconMessage "Put your message to send your users here. Dont forget to uncomment GlobalOnDefconMore"

# DefConOffMessage [OPTIONAL]
#
#     If this is defined, it will be used in place of GlobalOnDefcon and
#     GlobalOnDefconMore when defcon is returned to level 5
#DefConOffMessage "Services are now back to normal, sorry for any inconvenience"

# DefConAkillReason <text> [REQUIRED if DefCon is activated]
#
#     When using DEFCON this setting will be used when any clients are killed
#     or akilled from the network by defcon
#
#DefConAkillReason "This network is currently not accepting connections, please try again later"

#     GLOBAL command, and if you don't have a common domain name, this 
#     command may just not work.
#
#     You can specify more than one Network Domain by separating each one by
#     a space: NetworkDomain "localnet.net localnet.com"
