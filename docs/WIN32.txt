1) Building the Source

    NOTE: If you have downloaded one of the pre-compiled installers, you do
          NOT need to complete this step, and you can proceed to step 2.

    If you want to build Anope from source on a Win32 system, you will need
    to follow this instructions:

    1) Download the required files:

        * Current Anope source:
            http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=94081

        If you have Visual C++ 6, 7 (.NET 2002/2003) or 8 (2005) skip ahead to step 2, else you
        need to download the following free components from Microsoft. Once
        downloaded, install these packages.

		* Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition:
			http://www.microsoft.com/express/vc/

		or

        * Microsoft Visual C++ 2005 Express Edition:
            http://msdn.microsoft.com/vstudio/express/visualc/download/
            
		then download and install:

        * Microsoft Windows PlatformSDK: (Requires WGA validation)
	    http://www.microsoft.com/downloads/details.aspx?FamilyId=0BAF2B35-C656-4969-ACE8-E4C0C0716ADB&displaylang=en

	    (NOTE: Although this says for Windows Server 2003, it does infact work on all supported
	    versions of Windows.)
	    
	    When installing, you should select the Custom option, and ensure that the top option relating to 
	    the registering of environment varibales, is enabled in addition to the default selections.

	    If you do not do this, you may run into problems with the PSDK not being found properly during install.

        * MySQL for Windows (only needed if building with MySQL enabled):
            http://dev.mysql.com/

	    (NOTE: Anope can be compiled against MySQL Version 3.23 and above)


    2) Unpack the Anope tarball with your favorite uncompression program
       (WinZip or WinRAR, etc).

    3) Bring up the Visual C++ Command Prompt; This will launch a
       DOS Command Prompt like window, which will set the environment
       properties needed to make Anope.

       Change directories to where you unpacked the source code in step 2, by typing:

	cd <path to extracted source>
	
	e.g.

	cd c:\anope-stable
       
    4) You now need to configure Anope to your requirements. At the prompt type:
    
        Config.bat

       NOTE: If you run an Anti-Virus program such as McAfee or Norton, you may
       be unable to run this command due to the protection in place. Some Anti-
       Virus programs may detect the Anope Configuration Tool as a worm, however
       this is not the case. If you are prompted to allow or deny execution of 
       the script, you should choose allow. If the script fails to run, and no
       notice is displayed, please check your Anti-Virus settings before seeking
       assistance.
        
       An interactive configuration program should guide you through the install
       options, and then detect your Microsoft Visual C++ Library files. If it
       fails to detect them, you should check you have everything installed.

       If you cannot find whats causing the error, please visit our forums or
       our IRC Support channel for assistance.
 
    5) You are now ready to compile. At the prompt type:

        nmake -f Makefile.win32

       Once you are back at the command prompt again, if there have been no
       errors, you are ready to go. 

       Should you encounter errors with the installation process, check the
       messages displayed for advice on resolving them. If you are unable to
       resolve the issues yourself, seek assistance on our forums or in our
       IRC Support channel.

    6) Anope will install the files where they belong. The only thing you need
       to do is rename "data/example.conf" to be "data/services.conf".

    You have now completed the building phase of Anope for Windows. You can
    now move on to the next section, which is related to setting up Anope.

2) Installation

    Since Anope for Windows does not use a visual interface, you must do the
    configuration with a text editor before proceeding with running Anope
    itself.

    NOTE: You may need to open the configuration file with Wordpad, or a text
    editor which supports UNIX line endings. Opening the configuration file in
    Notepad will cause strange characters to appear, and you may not be able to
    edit the file correctly.

    Open services.conf, and read through it carefully and adjust the settings
    you think you need to adjust. Pay special attention to these settings:

    A) IRCDModule:   This is the name of an IRCd Module that Anope will use
                     to communicate with your server. Anope supports 15 IRCds,
                     so ensure you set the right value here.
    B) RemoteServer: This is the address to your ircd, along with the port
                     and password. You should consult your ircd
                     documentation on how to link ircds.
    C) ServicesRoot: Remove the # and change the names to your nick so you
                     can take control of services once they are online.
    D) UserKey1/2/3: Remove the # infront of the three UserKey settings, and
                     change the parameters to numbers; around 6-7 digits will
                     do.

    If you are unsure of the settings, you can go to the dos command prompt
    and run "anope.exe -nofork -debug" and watch the information as it
    attempts to connect.

    You can launch services in two ways. If you are sure that the entered
    configuration information is correct, simply double clicking the Anope
    executable will cause it to start; no window will pop up. If you'd rather
    have a more textual output, you can start at the dos prompt and type in
    "anope.exe". If services are successfully started up the dos prompt will
    seem to hang; at this point you can safely close the dos window.

3) Compiling Modules

    If you want to build other modules than the ones shipped by default, you
    will need to modify the Makefile.inc.win32 file, in the src\modules folder.

    A) Add modules; find the line stating "SRCS=" and add the name of the
       file to the end of the line. So if you have two files:

        SRCS=file.c file2.c
        
       If you are compiling a folder of module components, such as the example
       "catserv", you will need to add/change the "SUBS=" line. If you were
       compiling the "catserv" example, the line would look like this:
       
        SUBS=catserv

    B) When you've done this, use the same command prompt you set up in part
       1, change directories to the src\modules folder, and type:

        nmake -f Makefile.win32
        
       followed afterwards, by:

        nmake -f Makefile.win32 install
        
    C) You should now be able to load your modules on IRC via OperServ, or via
       the services.conf file.


4) Other compile options

	A) If you have trouble recompiling Anope, you should try:
	
		nmake -f Makefile.win32 distclean
		
		This will clean up the source directory and allow for chages to be applied
		to previously compiled files.
		
	B) A list of valid options are:
	
		install
		distclean
		clean
		spotless
		all
		core
		protocols
		mypasql
		languages
		modules
		
		The syntax for these options is:
		
		nmake -f Makefile.win32 [option]
