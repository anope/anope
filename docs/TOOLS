Anope Bundled Tools
-------------------

1) Anope SMTP Client

    Provided with Anope is a simple SMTP client which can be used instead of
    programs like SendMail in some cases.

    The SMTP client can be used instead of sendmail for use with Anope's mail
    options. To use the SMTP client instead of sendmail, find the line in your
    services configuration file (services.conf) that defines sendmailpath. On
    that line, change the path to your services installation directory, then
    followed by "bin/anopesmtp" and the IP address of a valid SMTP server. It
    should look like this:

        sendmailpath = "/home/ircd/anope/bin/anopesmtp 127.0.0.1"

    If the SMTP client doesn't send mail, or if there's an other problem with
    it, you can enable debug mode by passing the --debug flag after the server
    address. This should generate a log file of what happened when it tried
    to connect to the SMTP server.
