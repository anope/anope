# Example configuration file for Services.  After making the appropriate
# changes to this file, place it in the Services data directory (as
# specified in the "configure" script, default /home/username/services)
# under the name "services.conf".
#
# The format of this file is fairly simple: a line beginning with a # is a
# comment, and any other non-blank line is expected to be a directive and
# parameters, separated by spaces or tabs.  For example:
#
#   Directive Parameter-1 Parameter-2 ...
#
# Directives are case-insensitive.  Note that some directives do not take
# any parameters; these are typically "on-off" directives, for which simply
# including the directive in this file (or removing it) has an effect on
# Services' functionality.
#
# If a parameter's value is a string which includes spaces, enclose the
# string in double quotation marks, like the example below.  Quotes may be
# used around any string at all for clarity.
#
#   "This is a parameter string with spaces in it"
#
# If you need to include a double quote inside a quoted string, precede it
# by a backslash:
#
#   "This string has \"double quotes\" in it"
#
# Time parameters can be specified either as an integer representing a
# number of seconds (e.g. "3600" = 1 hour), or as an integer with a unit
# specifier: "s" = seconds, "m" = minutes, "h" = hours, "d" = days.
# Combinations (such as "1h30m") are not permitted.  Examples (all of which
# represent the same length of time, one day):
#
#   "86400", "86400s", "1440m", "24h", "1d"
#
# CAUTION:
# Please note that your services might _CRASH_ if you add more format-
# strings (%s, %d, etc.) to custom messages than Anope needs. Use the
# default messages to see how many format-strings are needed. 
#
# In the documentation for each directive, one of the following will be
# included to indicate whether an option is required:
#
# [REQUIRED]
#     Indicates a directive which must be given.  Without it, Services will
#     not start.
#
# [RECOMMENDED]
#     Indicates a directive which may be omitted, but omitting it may cause
#     undesirable side effects.
#
# [OPTIONAL]
#     Indicates a directive which is optional.  If not given, the feature
#     will typically be disabled.  If this is not the case, more
#     information will be given in the documentation.
#
# [DISCOURAGED]
#     Indicates a directive which may cause undesirable side effects if
#     specified.
#
# [DEPRECATED]
#     Indicates a directive which will disappear in a future version of
#     Services, usually because its functionality has been either
#     superseded by that of other directives or incorporated into the main
#     program.

# Encryption settings
#
###########################################################################

# EncModule <module_name>  [REQUIRED]
#     The encryption module to use when dealing with passwords.
#     This determines how the passwords are stored in the databases,
#     and does not add any security as far as transmitting passwords over
#     the network goes.
#     
#     enc_none provides no password encryption, storing the password in
#     plain text, this is the most versatile as passwords can easily be
#     recovered but is not secure and therefore not recommended for use.
#
#     NOTE: users of anope's previous (broken) md5 implementation should 
#     select the enc_old option, or things may break.
#
#     NOTE2: Some of these encryption methods are one-way (md5, sha1, old)
#     meaning that you can NOT retrieve the passwords in plain text once
#     encrypted.

# HelpChannel <channel> [OPTIONAL]
#
#     When defined, every users that has or gets op status on this channel

HelpChannel "#help"

# LogChannel <channel> [OPTIONAL]
#
#     When defined, services will output log messages to this channel.
#     IMPORTANT: This can be a security risk so make certain this channel
#     is sufficiently protected from normal access.

#LogChannel "#services"

# LogBot [OPTIONAL]
#
#     When defined, services will output all BotServ chatter to the defined
#     LogChan above. It shows all uses of BotServ ACT and SAY commands. Note
#     that there is no logging to the log file. Only works if LogChannel is
#     also defined.

#LogBot

# NetworkName <name> [REQUIRED]
# 
#     This is the name of the network the Services are running on.

NetworkName "LocalNet"

# Numeric [OPTIONAL]
#     Many ircd identify themselves with a Numeric ID when using this option
#     consult your ircds documentation before using this.
#
#     This option is REQUIRED when linking to InspIRCd 1.2. Then this should
#     contain the services SID and must be in the following form:
#         [0-9][A-Z0-9][A-Z0-9]
#     An example is shown below.

#Numeric "64"

# TS6 (InspIRCd 1.2+) compliant:

#Numeric "3AX"

# NickLen [RECOMMENDED]
#     Set this to the maximum allowed nick length on your network. Anope does
#     not support values larger than 31, so setting them makes no sense. Be
#     sure to set this correctly, as setting this wrong can result in services
#     being disconnected from the network.

#
#     These keys are required to initiate the random number generator. These
#     numbers MUST be random as you want your passcodes to be random. Don't
#     give these keys to anyone! Keep them private!
#
#     *** NOTE ***
#     If you don't enable these, or keep their default values, any talented
#     programmer would be able to easily "guess" random strings used to mask
#     information. Be safe, and come up with three different 7 digit numbers

#UserKey1 9866235
#UserKey2 8362013
#UserKey3 2362899

# NoBackupOkay  [DISCOURAGED]
#     Allows Services to continue file write operations (i.e. database
#     saving) even if the original file cannot be backed up.  Enabling this
#     option may allow Services to continue operation under some conditions
#     when it might otherwise fail, such as a nearly-full disk.
#
#     *** NOTE ***
#     Enabling this option can cause irrecoverable data loss under some
#     conditions, so make CERTAIN you know what you're doing when you
#     enable it!

#NoBackupOkay

# StrictPasswords  [RECOMMENDED]
#     When enabled, causes Services to perform more stringent checks on
#     passwords.  If this is disabled, Services will only disallow a
#     password if it is the same as the entity (nickname or channel name)
#     with which it is associated.  When enabled, however, Services will
#     also check that the password is at least five characters long, and
#     in the future will probably check other things as well.

StrictPasswords

# BadPassLimit <count>  [RECOMMENDED]
#     Sets the number of invalid password tries before Services removes a
#     user from the network.  If a user enters <count> invalid passwords
#     for any Services function or combination of functions during a
#     single IRC session (subject to BadPassTimeout, below), Services will
#     issue a /KILL for the user.  If not given, Services will ignore
#     failed password attempts (though they will be logged in any case).

BadPassLimit    5

# BadPassTimeout <time>  [OPTIONAL]
#     Sets the time after which invalid passwords are forgotten about.  If
#     a user does not enter any incorrect passwords in this amount of time,
#     the incorrect password count will reset to zero.  If not given, the
#     timeout will be disabled, and the incorrect password count will never
#     be reset until the user disconnects.

BadPassTimeout  1h

# UpdateTimeout <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the delay between automatic database updates.  This timer is
#     reset by the OperServ UPDATE command.

UpdateTimeout   5m

# ExpireTimeout <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the delay between checks for expired nicknames and channels.
#     The OperServ UPDATE command will also cause a check for expiration
#     and reset this timer.

ExpireTimeout   30m

# ReadTimeout <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the timeout period for reading from the network.

ReadTimeout 5s

# WarningTimeout <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the interval between sending warning messages for program
#     errors via WALLOPS/GLOBOPS.

WarningTimeout  4h

# TimeoutCheck <time>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the (maximum) frequency at which the timeout list is checked.
#     This, combined with ReadTimeout above, determine how accurately timed
#     events, such as nick kills, occur; it also determines how much CPU
#     time Services will use doing this.  Higher values will cause less
#     accurate timing but less CPU usage.
#
#     This shouldn't be set any higher than 10 seconds, and 1 second is
#     best if your system is powerful enough (or your network small enough)
#     to handle it.  0 will cause the timeout list to be checked every time
#     through the main loop, which will probably slow down Services too
#     much to be useful on most networks.
#
#     Note that this value is not an absolute limit on the period between
#     checks of the timeout list; the period may be as great as ReadTimeout
#     (above) during periods of inactivity.

TimeoutCheck    3s

# KeepLogs <days> [RECOMMENDED]
#
#     Sets the number of days log files are kept. If you don't give it, or if
#     you set it to 0, logs will be kept indefinitely.
#
#     NOTE: Services must run 24 hours a day for this feature to work.

KeepLogs 7

# KeepBackups <days> [RECOMMENDED]
#
#     Sets the number of days backups of databases are kept. If you don't give
#     it, or if you set it to 0, Services won't backup the databases.
#
#     NOTE: Services must run 24 hours a day for this feature to work.

KeepBackups 3

# ForceForbidReason [OPTIONAL]
#
#     If set, Services will require a reason when a forbid is added, else
#     the reason is optional. This directive also applies to SUSPENDed
#     channels as well.

ForceForbidReason

# UsePrivmsg [OPTIONAL]
#
#    This directive allows users to let Services send PRIVMSGs to them
#    instead of NOTICEs. Also see NSDefMsg, which also toggles the default
#    communication (PRIVMSG or NOTICE) to use for unregistered users.
#
#    This is a feature that is against the IRC RFC and should be used 
#    _only_ if absolutely necessary.

#UsePrivmsg

# UseStrictPrivMsg [OPTIONAL]
#    Using this directive will force services to only respond to privmsgs
#    addressed to Nick@ServerName - e.g. NickServ@localhost.net.
#    This should be used on conjunction with ircd aliases.
#
#    When using Bahamut, this option will NOT work if the uplink server is
#    configured as a services hub. The serviceshub option is not designed to
#    be used with Anope.

#UseStrictPrivMsg

# DumpCore [OPTIONAL]
#
#    Setting this directive will make Anope dump core when a segmentation
#    fault occurs. This is generally not needed, but if Anope is crashing
#    on your network and you want to make a bug report, having a core
#    file may be of great help.

#DumpCore

# LogUsers [OPTIONAL]
#
#    Defines whether Anope will log user connections, disconnections and
#    nickname changes. You may have to do so in case you ever need to
#    transmit user information to your local authorities.

#LogUsers

# HideStatsO [OPTIONAL]
#
#    Setting this directive will make Services only show Stats o to
#    IRC Operators.

#HideStatsO

# GlobalOnCycle [OPTIONAL]
#
#    Setting this directive will make Services send global messages on
#    starting up and shutting down/restarting.

#GlobalOnCycle

# GlobalOnCycleMessage <text> [REQUIRED if GlobalOnCycle is specified]
#     This is the global message sent when the Services are
#     being shutdown/restarted if using GlobalOnCycle
GlobalOnCycleMessage "Services are restarting, they will be back shortly - please be good while we're gone"

# GlobalOnCycleUP <text> [OPTIONAL]
#     If defined this message will be sent global when the services join
#     the network.
GlobalOnCycleUP "Services are now back online - have a nice day"

# AnonymousGlobal [OPTIONAL]
#     hides the oper's nick in a global message/notice
#AnonymousGlobal

# NickRegDelay <seconds> [OPTIONAL]
#     Prevents users from regging their nick if they are not
#     connected for at least X seconds.
#NickRegDelay 30

# UseSVSHOLD [OPTIONAL]
#     Allows networks running Bahamut (1.4.35 or later), Unreal (3.2),
#     and Plexus (3.0) to use SVSHOLD instead of the services enforcer.
#     This option places a temporary Q:Line on the held nick instead
#     of introducing a new pseudoclient with that nick, which is better
#     for both CPU and bandwidth. If you enable this option on an
#     incompatible IRCd (like a pre-1.4.35 Bahamut), it is most likely
#     to break.
#UseSVSHOLD

# RestrictOperNick [OPTIONAL]
#     Forbids the registration of nicks that contain nick with services
#     access. So if Tester is a Services Oper, for example, You can't
#     register NewTester or Tester123 unless you are an IRC operator.
#     IMPORTANT: Remember that you have to be an ircop if you want to
#                register the root's nick when setting up Anope for the
#                the first time.
#RestrictOperNicks

# UseTokens [OPTIONAL]
#     Allows irc networks to use TOKEN commands instead of the 
#     standard commands. This saves bandwidth but can break older
#     modules that are not set to trap for TOKEN - if you are using
#     older modules do NOT use this option
#UseTokens

# UseSVS2MODE [OPTIONAL]
#     On Unreal IRCD use SVS2MODE instead of SVSMODE, doing this will
#     show services changing user modes.
#UseSVS2MODE

# NewsCount [OPTIONAL]
#     The number of LOGON/OPER News item to display when a user logs
#     on. The default value is 3
#NewsCount 3

# UnRestrictSAdmin [OPTIONAL]
#     On many ircd Anope removes the umode of +a from users whom are not
#     Service Admin in Anope. This mode is NOT used by Anope for any form
#     of access. Thus this option allows them to keep the mode without having
#     to be a Service Admin in Anope
UnRestrictSAdmin

# UlineServers  [OPTIONAL]

# Mail-related options
#
###########################################################################

# NOTE: if UseMail is not set, all parameters after it in this section
# are optional.

# UseMail [OPTIONAL]
#
# This option enables the mail commands in Services. You may choose
# to disable it if you have no sendmail-compatible mailer installed.
# This setting is [REQUIRED] if NSEmailReg is enabled.

UseMail

# SendMailPath <path> [REQUIRED]
#
# This is how we should call SendMail to send a mail. It must be
# called with all parameters needed to make it scan the mail input
# to find the mail recipient; consult your SendMail documentation.
#
# Postfix users must use the compatible sendmail utility provided
# with it; this one usually needs no parameters on the command line.
# Most sendmail applications (or replacements of it) require the -t
# option to be used.

SendMailPath "/usr/sbin/sendmail -t"

# SendFrom <e-mail> [REQUIRED]
#
# This is the e-mail from which all the e-mails are to be sent. It should
# really exist.

SendFrom services@localhost.net

# RestrictMail [OPTIONAL]
#
# When enabled, SENDPASS will be restricted to IRC operators.
#
# WARNING: if you choose to not enable this option, you should limit
# the number of processes the services user can have at a time (you can
# create a special user for this; remember to never launch Services as root).

RestrictMail

# MailDelay <time> [RECOMMENDED]
#
# This controls the minimum amount of time an user must wait before sending
# another mail after it has sent one. It also controls the minimum time
# an user must wait before it can receive another mail.
#
# This feature prevents users from being mail bombed using Services and
# should definitely be used.

MailDelay 5m

# DontQuoteAddresses [OPTIONAL]
#
# When enabled, services will not attempt to "" the TO: fields in mails
#
# So far we only know of ESMTP/QMail which need this set.
#

#DontQuoteAddresses

# ForkForMail [OPTIONAL]
#
# When enabled, services will fork when sending mail, which means there is no
# services lag from mail. This is only supported on operating systems that allow
# the use of forking (eg, not Windows).

# NSForceEmail [RECOMMENDED]
#     This option forces the users to give an e-mail when they register
#     a nickname. If you have nicks in the database that have no e-mail
#     set, they will be asked to set an e-mail when they identify their
#     nickname until they set one. Also, this option prevents user from
#     unsetting the password. This setting is [REQUIRED] if NSEmailReg
#     is enabled.
#
#     This option is useful to resolve "lost password" problems.

NSForceEmail

# NSEmailReg [OPTIONAL]
#      This option splits the nick registration into 2 steps,  the first
#      after registering a email with a passcode is sent to the supplied
#      email address, this passcode needs to be entered with a confirm
#      command before the nick registration will be completed.
#
#      You must have mail / forcemail set for this to work correctly.
#      It is also recommended that MailDelay be set to a sensible value
#      to prevent mail flooding. This setting is [REQUIRED] if NSEmailReg
#      is enabled.

# NSEmailReg

# NSDef...  [OPTIONAL]
#     Sets the default options for newly registered nicks.  Note that
#     changing these options will have no effect on nicks which are already

#
#     If both NSDefKill and NSDefKillQuick are given, the latter takes
#     precedence.  KILL IMMED cannot be specified as a default.
#
#     Note: Both NSDefKill and NSDefKillQuick must be specified for Quick to take effect.
#
#     NSDefMsg also controls the default setting for unregistered users.
#     If NSDefMsg is enabled, unregistered users will receive PRIVMSGs
#     instead of NOTICEs from Services. See UsePrivmsg for more information.
#
#     NOTE:  If you do not enable any of these options, a default of
#     Secure, MemoSignon, and MemoReceive will be used, for backward
#     compatibility.  If you really want no options enabled by default, use

# CSAccessMax <count>  [REQUIRED]
#     Sets the maximum number of entries on a channel's access list.
#     Channel access lists may contain only registered nicknames;
#     therefore, checking each entry on the list requires only a single
#     scaler comparison instead of a wildcard match, and this limit may be

MSMaxMemos  20

# MSSendDelay <time>  [RECOMMENDED]
#     Sets the delay between consecutive uses of the MemoServ SEND command.
#     This can help prevent spam as well as denial-of-service attacks from
#     sending large numbers of memos and filling up disk space (and

# MSNotifyAll  [OPTIONAL]
#     Should we notify all appropriate users of a new memo?  This applies

# BSSmartJoin [OPTIONAL]
#    The bot is currently not affected by any modes or bans when he

#    that affect the bot before joining the channel, remove a
#    ban that affects the bot set by an user when it is on the
#    channel, and so on. Since it consumes a bit more CPU time,
#    you should not comment it out on larger networks.

# BSSmartJoin

# BSGentleBWReason [OPTIONAL]
#    This option will make the bot use a kick reason that does not retake

# LimitSessions  [OPTIONAL]
#     Enables session limiting. Session limiting prevents users from 
#     connecting more than a certain number of times from the same host at the
#     same time - thus preventing most types of cloning. Once a host reaches 
#     it's session limit, all clients attempting to connect from that host 
#     will be killed. Exceptions to the default session limit can be defined
#     via the exception list. It should be noted that session limiting, along
#     with a large exception list, can degrade services' performance.
#     See the source and comments in sessions.c and the online help for more
#     information about session limiting.
#
#     NOTE:  This option is not available when STREAMLINED is defined in

#     The message that will be NOTICE'd to a user just before they are removed
#     from the network because their's host session-limit has been exceeded. 
#     It may be used to give a slightly more descriptive reason for the

#     The channel modes to set on all channel's when the DefCon channel
#     mode system is in use.
#
#     NOTE: Choose these modes carefully, because when defcon switches to
#     a level which does NOT have the mode setting selected, services will
#     set the reverse on all channel's, e.g. if this setting is +RN
#     when defcon is used all channel's will be set to +RN, when
#     defcon is removed, channels will all be set to -RN. You don't
#     want to set this to +k for example because when defcon is removed all
#     channels will -k.
#     NOTE: mlock'ed modes will not be lost
#DefConChanModes "+R"

# DefConTimeOut <time> [OPTIONAL]
#     This value can be used to automatically return the network to
#     defcon 5 after the specified time period - just in case any opers
#     forget to remove a defcon setting.
#DefConTimeOut 15m

# GlobalOnDefcon [OPTIONAL]
#
#     Setting this directive will make Services send a global message on
#     Defcon Level changes.
#GlobalOnDefcon

# GlobalOnDefconMore [OPTIONAL]
#
#     Setting this directive will make Services send a global message on
#     Defcon Level changes. Uncommenting this will allow you to send along
#     with the new level, the DefconMessage.
#GlobalOnDefconMore

#DefconMessage "Put your message to send your users here. Dont forget to uncomment GlobalOnDefconMore"

# DefConOffMessage [OPTIONAL]
#
#     If this is defined, it will be used in place of GlobalOnDefcon and
#     GlobalOnDefconMore when defcon is returned to level 5
#DefConOffMessage "Services are now back to normal, sorry for any inconvenience"

# DefConAkillReason <text> [REQUIRED if DefCon is activated]
#
#     When using DEFCON this setting will be used when any clients are killed
#     or akilled from the network by defcon
#
#DefConAkillReason "This network is currently not accepting connections, please try again later"
