## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not report security vulnerabilities on GitHub. Instead, email the details to team@anope.org or get the attention of a developer in our development IRC channel at irc.teranova.net #anope-devel and PM them the details.

We will triage your issue as soon as possible and try to release a fixed version within a week of receiving your report.
