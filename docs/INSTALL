1. Installing Anope
-------------------

IMPORTANT NOTE: it is not recommended to use (and therefore install)
Anope as root. Use an unprivileged user instead -- the one you're
using for the ircd or a dedicated one will be good enough.

The very first thing you need to do is to get the Anope package
(if not already done). You can find it at the following place:

    http://www.anope.org/
    
Next, unpack the package in your home directory, and go into the
created directory.
  
Now type ./configure to start the configuration script. It will
ask you a few questions, and figure out how to compile Anope on
your system. If you are unsure about the answer to a question,
use the default value. 

NOTE: although you may specify different binary and data paths, 
      it is RECOMMENDED that you use the same value for both.

You can now type make to compile Anope. If there are errors in the
Makefile, *try to use gmake* instead. If it still doesn't work, you
(or the system administrator if it's a shell) must install GNU
make. You may find it at ftp://prep.ai.mit.edu/pub/gnu/.

Now type make install (or gmake install; see above). This will
install all the needed files in the paths you specified with the
configure script, and setup file permissions. You should ensure
that the data directory is not accessible by other users, as malicious 
users may cause troubles on your network if passwords are not 
encrypted, or read the memos of any user.

If you see errors during this process, please mail us with the 
*complete* error output, and don't forget to mention your OS, 
compiler and C library versions. 

Now go into the data directory (by default, ~/services). Copy the
example.conf file to services.conf, and open the latter with your
favorite text editor. It contains all the configuration
directives Anope will use at startup. Read the instructions contained
in the file carefully. Using the default values is NOT a good idea,
and will most likely not work!

If you need help, you should subscribe to the Anope mailing list and
mail there to get help from other users. See the README file for more
information.


2. Upgrading Anope
------------------

If you got a .diff file and want to patch the old Anope sources with it, do 
the following:
  * Copy the .diff file into the root Anope sources directory.
  * Type patch -p1 <file.diff

To upgrade Anope, just follow the installation instructions described in
section 1. There are however a few specific guidelines:

  * IMPORTANT: Back up your old databases!
  * If you are upgrading to a new major release, ALWAYS restart a 
    fresh configuration file from example.conf.


3. Setting up the IRCd
----------------------

Services acts as an IRC server with pseudo-clients on it. To link
them to your network, you'll need to add some lines in the ircd.conf
of their hub server (as stated in the RemoteServer configuration
directive).

For samples below we'll take Services.LocalHost.Net as the name of
the Services (as stated in the ServerName configuration directive).

First, the C/N lines, that allow Services to link. They also need a
Y:line to work correctly.

Y:27:180:0:0:4000000
C:127.0.0.1:mypass:Services.LocalHost.Net::30
N:127.0.0.1:mypass:Services.LocalHost.Net::30

mypass is the same password you mentioned in the RemoteServer 
configuration directive. 127.0.0.1 is the IP from which Services
connect from (linking in localhost is the most efficient way
to run Services).

Then, you have to set-up an U:line, that will allow Services to
change channel modes, topics, and much more without being opped 
in the channel.

U:Services.LocalHost.Net:*:*

NOTE: if you have more than one server in your network, this line
MUST be added on ALL servers, or things won't work.

Finally, you'll need to add an H:line, to make the OperServ JUPE
command work correctly.

H:*::Services.LocalHost.Net

Don't forget to /rehash to apply changes.

A new trend in ircd configuration is popping all over the place,
good examples are the latest Hybrid and Unreal, which use a more
"readable" for of configuration. For those, use something like:

link Services.LocalHost.Net
{
        username        *;
        hostname        localhost;
        bind-ip         *;
        port            6667;
        hub             *;
        password-connect "mypass";
        password-receive "mypass";
        class           servers;
};


4. Starting Anope
-----------------

Go into the directory where binaries were installed (by default,
~/services). Type ./services to launch Anope.

If there are syntax errors in the configuration file they will be 
displayed on the screen. Correct them until there are no errors 
anymore. A successful startup won't generate any message. 

Give to Services at least one minute to link to your network, as 
certain IRCds on some OSes may be really slow for the link process.
If nothing happens then, it is probably a configuration problem.
Try to launch Anope with ./services -debug -nofork to see any errors
that it encounters, and try to correct them.

If you need help to solve errors, feel free to subscribe to the
Anope mailing list and ask there. See the README file for details.


5. Setting up a crontab
-----------------------

A crontab entry will allow you to check periodically whether Anope
is still running, and restart it if not. You'll need to have
Anope binaries and data installed in the same directory for this to
work without modification.

First rename the example.chk script that is in Anope path (by default, 
~/services) to services.chk and edit it. You'll need to modify the 
CONFIGURATION part of the file. Then ensure that the file is marked as 
executable by typing chmod +x services.chk, and try to launch the script 
to see if it works (Anope must not be running when you do this ;).

When this is done, you'll have to add the crontab entry. Type crontab -e.
This will open the default text editor with the crontab file. Enter the
following (with correct path):
*/5 * * * * /home/ircd/services/services.chk >/dev/null 2>&1
The */5 at the beginning means "check every 5 minutes". You may replace
the 5 with other another number if you want (but less than 60).
Save and exit, and it's installed.
