=============================

After the change from Epona to Anope
------------------------------------
  * New Italian Language file
  * Added support for UltimateIRCd 3.0 and later
  * Services realtime logging to a channel
  * SuperAdmin directive for access to "super" commands.
  * Ban system is now exception aware.
  * HostServ for hostname masquerading.
  * Smarter XOP System.
  * Email verification/handshake upon registration.
  * Services can now /ignore users.
  * Smarter memo notification for channels.
  * Channel can be SUSPENDed instead of FORBIDen.

Before the change from Epona to Anope
-------------------------------------
  * HostServ for networks that support them.
  * UnrealIRCd support has been rewritten, it is now fully 
    working (hopefully) and officially supported again.
  * Added support for UltimateIRCd 2.8.2 and later. 
  * A multi-threaded proxy detector that can scan Wingates, 
    SOCKS 4/5 and HTTP proxies on ports 3128 and 8080. Don't use
    it if you have not been authorized to use it by your system
    administrator!
  * The ChanServ AOP/SOP/VOP commands, and, on networks that
    support halfops, the HOP command, have been added. They
    allow a more user-friendly control of channel privileges.
  * Use of services IDs that allow an user to be automatically
    identified after a split (if he was identified before the split)
    in a secure way. This also saves lots of bandwidth.
  * Services' default language can now be set in services.conf.
  * The OperServ RANDOMNEWS command provides an easy way to show
    network news in a random manner without flooding your users
    with them (one news per connection).
  * The BotServ SET PRIVATE option allows services admins to 
    make the bot usable by IRC operators only.
  * The OperServ SQLINE command allows you to forbid nick masks
    and even channel masks with the latest Bahamut.
  * The ChanServ AKICK STICK command allows akicks to be permanently
    kept on channel.
  * The ChanServ SET TOPIC command has been renamed to TOPIC, and
    a new BAN command has been added. They both have their own
    associated levels.
  * A SET PEACE command has been added to ChanServ. It prevents
    users to use pejorative services commands (DEOP, KICK, ...)
    on users with greater or equal levels.

Networks using Bahamut must upgrade to Bahamut 1.4.27 or later, 
while networks using UnrealIRCd must upgrade to Unreal 3.1.1.
