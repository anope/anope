#     The encryption module to use when dealing with passwords.
#     This determines how the passwords are stored in the databases,
#     and does not add any security as far as transmitting passwords over
#     the network goes.
#     enc_none provides no password encryption, storing the password in
#     plain text, this is the most versiatle as passwords can easily be
#     recovered.
#
#     NOTE: users of anope's previous (broken) md5 implementation should 
#     select the enc_old option, or things may break.
#
#     NOTE2: Some of these encryption methods are one-way (md5, sha1, old)

# LimitSessions  [OPTIONAL]
#     Enables session limiting. Session limiting prevents users from

#     it's session limit, all clients attempting to connect from that host 
#     will be killed. Exceptions to the default session limit, which are based 
#     on host names, can be defined via the exception list. It should be noted
#     that session limiting, along with a large exception list, can degrade
#     services' performance. See the source and comments in sessions.c and the

#     Services thinks it has found clones.
#
#     This feature has been superseded by Session Limiting.
#

#
#     This feature has been superceded by Session Limiting.
#
#     BEWARE!  The clone checking code is easily fooled; it can be

# ProxyDetect [OPTIONAL]
#
# Enables insecure proxy detection. Services will automatically

#
# Anope currently supports detection of Wingate (port 23), SOCKS4/5
# (port 1080), and HTTP proxy (ports 3128 and 8080). It uses the
# protocol of each proxy type to connect to an IRC server, it does
# not only check if the port is open (so your users may still have
# an open telnet server on their port 23 for example).
#
# WARNING: You should get the authorization of the administrator of
# the computer which runs the proxy detector before enabling it; not
# all administrators will accept it. Also note that in certain
# countries, port scanning is prohibited.
#
# This feature requires threading support to be compiled into Anope.

#ProxyDetect

# ProxyThreads <number> [REQUIRED]
#
# Sets the number of threads Services will launch when starting. Each

#
# This value must be set depending of the number of users you have
# on your network. The more threads are used, the more simultaneous
# checks can be done. Remember however, that threads are
# resource-consuming.
#
# WARNING: On Linux, each thread takes a background process, and there
# is an additional process used for thread management; this is a problem
# if you are limited in the number of background process you can use
# (on a paid shell for example).

# When enabled, this option makes the services send an (SVS)KILL command
# immediately after SQLINE ADD. This eliminates the need of killing the

# NetworkDomain <name> [OPTIONAL]
#
#     If your network has a common domain name, specify it there (for
#     example, all IRCZONE servers have a name ending in ".irczone.cl",
#     so "irczone.cl" would be set there.
#
#     You can specify more than one Network Domain by separating each one by
#     a space: NetworkDomain "localnet.net localnet.com"
#
#     Note that this directive is no longer used by the GLOBAL command, since
#     it uses a dynamic list of connected servers regardless of their
#     domains. However, some modules may still use this value, so you might
#     want to keep it just in case.

NetworkDomain "localnet.com"

# ListOpersOnly  [DEPRECATED]
#     When enabled, limits use of the ChanServ and NickServ LIST commands
#     to IRC operators.
#
#     This directive has been superseded by the NSListOpersOnly and
#     CSListOpersOnly directives.

** ADDED    CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES **

# UserKey1|2|3 <value> [REQUIRED]
#     
#     These keys are required to initiate the random number generator. These
#     numbers MUST be random as you want your passcodes to be random. Don't
#     give these keys to no anyone! Keep them private!

#UserKey1 9866235
#UserKey2 5216332
#UserKey3 9651291


# RestrictOperNick [OPTIONAL]
#     Forbids the registration of nicks that contain nick with services        
#     access. So if Tester is a Services Oper, for example, You can't 
#     register NewTester or Tester123 unless you are an IRC operator.
#RestrictOperNicks

# UseTokens [OPTIONAL]
#     Allows irc networks to use TOKEN commands instead of the 
#     standard commands. This saves bandwidth but can break older
#     modules that are not set to trap for TOKEN - if you are using
#     older modules do NOT use this option
#UseTokens

# UseSVS2MODE [OPTIONAL]
#     On Unreal IRCD use SVS2MODE instead of SVSMODE, doing this will
#     show services changing user modes.
#UseSVS2MODE

# NewsCount [OPTIONAL]
#     The number of LOGON/OPER News item to display when a user logs
#     on. The default value is 3
#NewsCount 3

# Numeric [OPTIONAL]
#     Many ircd identify themselves with a Numeric when using this option
#     consult your ircds documentation before using this
#Numeric 0

# UnRestrictSAdmin [OPTIONAL]
#     On many ircd Anope removes the umode of +a from users whom are not
#     Service Admin in Anope. This mode is NOT used by Anope for any form
#     of access. Thus this option allows them to keep the mode without having
#     to be a Service Admin in Anope

** ADDED    CONFIGURATION DIRECTIVES **

# UseSVSHOLD [OPTIONAL]
#     Allows Bahamut-networks to use SVSHOLD instead of the services
#     enforcer. This option has been introduced in Bahamut 1.4.35 and
#     places a temporary Q:Line instead of introducing a new nick,
#     which is better for both CPU and bandwidth. If you enable this
#     option on a pre-1.4.35 Bahamut, it is most likely to break.
